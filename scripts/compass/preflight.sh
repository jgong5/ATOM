# This is not only for GPU tasks. On a wedged node ATOM's *import* hangs, because

# task hangs too, and looks like a bug in the task.

# --- 0. D-state census -------------------------------------------------------
# What this counts is whatever this PID namespace can see, which in a container
# is not the node. MEASURED 2026-09-20T08:45Z on hjbog-srdc-39, the same second
# from both sides: the host had 10840 processes of which 2236 were in D state;
# the jgong5_vllm container on it saw 3171 and 103. `docker inspect
# -f '{{.HostConfig.PidMode}}'` is empty, so the namespace is private and there
# is no /host/proc bind-mount to look through. The container census sees 4.6% of
# the D-state processes that are actually there.
#
# The threshold of 20 was calibrated on host-wide readings -- 0 on a healthy
# node, 2183 on the wedged one. Against a container-local count, a number under
# it means only "nothing is wedged in here". It does not mean the node is clear,
# so this check reports PARTIAL rather than a clear: the question was not
# answered, and an unanswered question must not read as a "no".
#
# So the census reports its own scope, and the scope is measured rather than
# assumed: a readable host procfs is used when one is mounted, and otherwise the
# container is detected positively rather than inferred from the count.
#
# Counting is done over /proc directly rather than with `ps`, so an alternative
# procfs can be counted the same way, and so the check has one less dependency
# on a node where a wedge makes the process tools themselves unreliable.
#
# Each entry is read by the shell rather than handed to awk as a glob. The
# container's awk is mawk 1.3.4, and mawk treats an input file it cannot open as
# FATAL: a process that exits between glob expansion and read -- routine on a
# shared box -- takes the whole census down with rc=2 and NO output at all, END
# never runs, CENSUS comes back empty and this check reports UNMEASURED. In
# gate_gpu.sh that is `ABORT: pre-flight failed before the run` and a booked GPU
# slot spent on a vanished PID. Measured rare -- 0 aborts in 60 consecutive real
# censuses over a 3179-process namespace -- and cheap to remove, so it is
# removed: `read` is a builtin, forks nothing, reads only the first line, and a
# vanished entry is skipped rather than fatal.
