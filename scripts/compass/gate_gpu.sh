# Per-wave test gate: the driver-dependent superset of what gate_cpu.sh runs.
# Judged as a DELTA, not as green -- the baseline carries failures. A report
# that says "green" has not read it.
#
# The delta is judged on the failing node-IDS, not only on their count:
# gpu_gate_known_failures.txt beside this script names them verbatim. "5 failed"
# could never be checked against "the SAME 5 failed"; a list can.
#
# Also run per-task by any change gate_cpu.sh flags against
# gpu_gate_triggers.txt. That check is mechanical now; this comment is no longer
# the only place the rule lives.
#
# Run in the GPU container. preflight.sh is invoked here, before and after the
# run -- it used to be named in a comment and called by nobody.
#
# Five ways a green verdict was previously reachable on an unmeasured run, all
# of them measured, all of them now refusals:
#   - a summary carrying `N errors` was parsed for passed/failed only, so a run
#     with 12 collection errors read as PASS (reviewer, replayed at :102-163);
#   - pytest's own exit status was captured and never consulted, so rc=2
#     (interrupted) or rc=4 (usage error) read as a measurement;
#   - a caller's `-rE` overrode this script's `-rf` -- pytest's `-r` is
#     store-last-wins -- so NO `FAILED ` lines were printed, the by-name check
#     compared against an empty observed set, and the gate reported all five
#     baseline failures as "no longer failing" and exited 0 while they had in
#     fact failed (EXECUTED on d78f3bbd3, run 2, gate_gpu_run2_rE.log);
#   - `GONE_IDS` only printed a note, so "the by-name check found nothing" and
#     "the failures were fixed" were one reading;
#   - the pass count was a floor, so the new tests every task adds loosened it
#     by exactly enough to absorb a silently skipped file.
#
# One way is NOT a refusal, and this header claimed otherwise until 2026-09-20
# ("EVERY question this gate cannot answer is a refusal"). A toolchain differing
# from the baseline's -- including an AITER version that reads UNKNOWN, which
# :162-163 explicitly calls a mismatch -- warns on stderr and can still end
# GATE_GPU_RC=0. All five known failures are AITER-kernel numerics, so on an
# AITER bump the delta compares two different things and exits 0 anyway. Making
# it a refusal is a behaviour change with its own cost -- a `git describe` that
# cannot read aiter's checkout would then block every run on a node where the
# stack is fine -- so the gap is stated here rather than closed unilaterally.

# GATE_GPU_RC is printed exactly once, on stdout, on every path -- including the

# node-id) printed it twice with no statement of which was the verdict, four
# FATAL paths printed it not at all, and the failure verdicts went to stderr
# while the success verdict went to stdout -- so `gate_gpu.sh 2>/dev/null | grep
