# Per-task test gate: the 130 of 189 test files that run without a GPU driver,
# ~30 s. Green is the bar: this subset really is green.
#
# Excluded, and why neither is a judgement call:
#   tests/plugin/          30 files, needs sglang + vllm -- in neither image
#   cpu_gate_exclude.txt   29 files that reach the driver: 28 at *collection*
#                          time via rocminfo, plus 1 that collects and then
#                          fails on a driver call. That file names which is
#                          which, and only the first group is generated.
#
# What this tier cannot see is not left to memory. gpu_gate_triggers.txt lists
# the source paths whose only coverage is in the excluded set; a diff touching
# one of them fails this gate with an instruction to run gate_gpu.sh. Before
# that, the rule was a sentence in a design document and nothing read it.
#
# Run in the CPU container. Regenerate the exclusion list with
# regen_cpu_gate_exclude.sh; never hand-edit the GENERATED section.

# GATE_CPU_RC is printed exactly once, on every path out of this script. It is
# defined here, above the first exit, and not further down beside the pytest
# result, because three drafts got the arithmetic of "exactly once" wrong in
# three different ways:
#   - an early draft printed it after pytest and again after the blind-spot
#     check, so a run that failed the second emitted `GATE_CPU_RC=0` followed by
#     `GATE_CPU_RC=98`, and anything grepping for the first answer got the wrong
#     one;
#   - a second draft exited before pytest on an unanswerable GPU question, so
#     that run printed it zero times -- equally unusable to a caller;
#   - a third draft -- this one, until the review that produced this comment --
#     defined finish() *below* seven FATAL exits. A tree that could not be
#     resolved, an unreadable exclusion list, or a stale --ignore= line all left
#     the script with no verdict line at all, which reads to a caller exactly
#     like a run that has not finished yet. A gate that cannot say it failed has
#     not failed safely.
# The rule this encodes: the verdict is the script's only output contract, so no
# path may skip it, including the ones that give up before measuring anything.
#
# The verdict line also carries its reason, because it is the only line every
# pipe keeps. `gate_cpu.sh | tail -6` hands the caller tail's exit status, not
# this script's, and nothing a script does can change that: the status of a
# pipeline belongs to the caller's shell. What survives is the text, and the
# three common pipes keep different parts of it -- `2>/dev/null | tail -6` drops
# every stderr line, so a bare `GATE_CPU_RC=98` there sits under pytest's green
# summary with nothing to say why it is not a pass. Stated on the verdict line,
# the reason survives any pipe that keeps the verdict at all.
#
# Refusing to run when stdout is a pipe was weighed and rejected. It cannot tell
# `| tail` from the callers that keep the status: under `docker exec`, which is
# how the gate runs on the CPU node, stdout is a FIFO too, as it is under any
# harness that captures output. Every normal run would need an override, and an
# override set by habit lets `| tail` through with it.
