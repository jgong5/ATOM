# Regenerate gpu_gate_triggers.txt -- the source paths that no *running*
# CPU-tier test names. Run after any change to cpu_gate_exclude.txt; the two
# files are derived from the same tree and are wrong separately.
#
# THE RULE, in one sentence: an atom module named by an excluded test is a blind
# spot unless a CPU-tier test that actually runs names it too.
#
# Three decisions make that sentence operational. Decisions 1 and 3 were each
# forced by a measured counter-example in this tree, named below so the next
# reader does not have to rediscover it; decision 2 removes no path from this
# tree and is kept as a forward guard, which is also said below rather than left
# to be inferred from this sentence.
#
#   1. Imports are read at ANY indentation, not just column 0. The previous
#      version anchored on `^`, and at fada7424e 190 `import atom.*` lines in
#      non-plugin test files were indented -- function-local and guarded imports
#      were the dominant idiom. It was reading roughly a third of the import lines
#      it claimed to read.
#
#   2. A test whose file is not collected covers nothing, so coverage is
#      credited only from a CPU-tier file that `pytest --collect-only` shows
#      collecting at least one test. MEASURED at 236abfd9a in xiaobizh_n18_cpu,
#      2026-09-20: this probe removes NO path from this tree. Run whole with it,
#      and whole without it -- crediting every CPU-tier file, collecting or not
#      -- the result is 30 triggers both ways and the difference is empty. It
#      withholds 15 coverage paths; exactly one of them,
#      atom/model_ops/v4_kernels/state_writes.py, is even a candidate, and that
#      one sits under the candidate SUBTREE entry atom/model_ops/v4_kernels/,
#      so the collapse at the bottom of this script absorbs it whether its
#      coverage was credited or not. It is kept as a forward guard on trees this
#      one does not represent, NOT because anything here depends on it, and it
#      is not free: a full `pytest --collect-only` over the CPU tier, plus a
#      refusal path (exit 97). Decision 3, not this one, carries both of the
#      measured counter-examples.
#
#   3. The two sides are deliberately ASYMMETRIC, and the asymmetry is what
#      carries both counter-examples. Candidates come from any import in an
#      excluded test. Coverage is subtracted only for a MODULE-LEVEL import in a
#      CPU-tier file that collects at least one test -- the only imports this
#      tree can prove execute, since collection imports the module. An indented
#      import in a CPU-tier file is not credited, because text cannot tell
#      whether its enclosing test ran. Two paths turn on that, both measured at
#      236abfd9a in xiaobizh_n18_cpu:
#        - atom/model_ops/topK.py. Its only excluded-side reference is
#          `test_moe_dp_token_capacity.py:39`, indented under
#          `skipif(not torch.cuda.is_available())` and skipped in the CPU
#          container. Read coverage at any indentation and the set goes 30 -> 29,
#          losing exactly this path.
#        - atom/model_engine/model_runner.py. `tests/test_mla_index_cache.py`
#          imports ModelRunner at LINES 99-100, indented four spaces inside a
#          test function -- NOT at module level, whatever earlier drafts of this
#          comment said. The indentation is what leaves it uncredited; what the
#          file collects does not enter into it. Read coverage at any
#          indentation AND credit non-collecting files and the set goes 30 -> 27,
#          losing this path, atom/model_ops/attentions/aiter_mla.py and topK.py.
#
# Where this is still wrong, in both directions, so neither is a surprise:
#
#   - Toward FIRING: an indented import in a CPU-tier test that does run is not
#     credited, so its module can appear here although the CPU tier exercises it.
#     Coverage subtraction is also exact-string, so a candidate SUBTREE entry is
#     never cancelled by coverage of the files under it, and a candidate file is
#     never cancelled by coverage of its package.
#   - Toward SILENCE: imports are read as text, not resolved as a graph. A module
#     reached only transitively -- imported by a module a test imports -- is
#     invisible to both sides. A path absent from the output is NOT a claim that
#     the CPU tier covers it.
#
# So the output is neither a floor nor a ceiling. Of the two mistakes, this file
# prefers firing: running the GPU tier when in doubt is never the wrong one.
# Decision 3 is that preference, written down.
