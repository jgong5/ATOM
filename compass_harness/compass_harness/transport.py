"""aiperf's ``http`` transport, timed on the Compass clock instead of the wall clock.

Runs in each aiperf worker. The traffic LP in ``timing_manager`` stamps every
request it sends with an ``(arrival, seq)`` on the HTTP channel and publishes it
on the adapter's stamp socket, keyed by credit; the stamp and the credit reach
the worker in either order. The request carries its stamp in ``tracestate``.
Each SSE event ATOM streams back carries its own stamp in a comment line; the
transport reports each one to the traffic LP as it arrives, ``[DONE]`` marked
final, and rewrites the record's times from the stamps, so aiperf's TTFT, ITL
and latency read simulated time measured from the send.

The two sockets live under the path prefix in ``COMPASS_HARNESS_IPC``.
