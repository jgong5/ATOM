"""Compass adapter for agentx-harness (aiperf).

aiperf's plugin discovery imports this package while ``aiperf.plugin.plugins``
is still initialising, so nothing here imports aiperf at module level: an
import error escaping from here makes discovery drop the whole plugin with one
WARNING line.

Importing the package installs an import hook that rebinds a module global of
each aiperf module in ``REBIND`` once that module has executed. The runner's
``LoopScheduler`` becomes ``ClockPacedLoopScheduler``, so every phase runner's
scheduler, and the branch orchestrator and replay barrier it is handed to, pace
on the Compass clock; the hook then refuses the run unless this package's
strategy is the registered ``agentic_replay``. The timing manager's
``StickyCreditRouter`` becomes ``CompassCreditRouter``, which binds that clock
to the traffic LP.
