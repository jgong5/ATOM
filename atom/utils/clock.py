"""The logical-process side of the simulated clock: time requests, sends and release.

One `LPRuntime` per logical process (LP), in the process of its clock owner: the
engine step loop or the frontend event loop. The owner is the only thread that
moves the LP clock and the only one that produces a cross-LP message. It asks the
clock authority for time over an injected connection, ``conn.send((kind, t,
log, t_daemon))`` then ``conn.recv() -> (G, released)``, and every request
carries the sends registered since the previous one, so the authority knows each
message an LP produced before it moves that LP's clock.

A grant to ``+inf`` closes the simulation window (`end_run`) before the process
begins to shut down: the run is finished, and the owner's loop must exit rather
than run its timers at ``+inf``. A clock call after it raises; the wrappers send
shutdown frames unstamped (arrival ``None``), so only a direct `stamp_send` call
returns a ``+inf`` arrival; and `close` raises if the owner leaves before it.

A grant names the messages it releases as ``{channel: [(seq, arrival)]}``.
`_step_through` releases them one at a time in ``(arrival, channel, seq)``
order, setting the LP clock to each arrival. On a ``thread`` channel it then
waits until the receiving thread is back at its wait point, so a handler runs
with the clock at its message's arrival and nothing else in the LP moving. An
``inline`` channel is read by the owner itself at its own receive point, so
there is nothing to wait for. Messages are counted by ``(channel, seq)``, so a
channel need not be FIFO. The ``(channel, seq)`` sets here are only ever tested
for membership, never iterated.

The receive side (`WrappedSocket`, `WrappedPoller`) calls `check_arrival` for
every stamped frame it reads, holds a frame back until `is_released`, and
brackets handing one to ATOM with `handed_over` and `back_at_wait_point`. The
send side stamps each frame with `stamp_send`, directly or through the
`RelayQueue` that stands in for the engine's output queue.
