"""The frontend LP's tokenizer station: thread-pool jobs on the simulated clock.

Tokenization runs for real, for its result, and is charged a modelled duration
for its time. A `Station` is a multi-server FIFO over that charged time: job k,
submitted at ``t_k``, starts at ``s_k = max(t_k, earliest free server)`` and
completes at ``c_k = s_k + its charged service``. Jobs are placed in submission
order, whatever order their real threads finish in.

`SimExecutor` is the event loop's default executor. From `SimExecutor.start_run`
on, `classify` sorts every job by name: ``do_preprocess`` is a service job on
the station; ``Queue.get`` is a wait job passed straight through, since a
channel event completes it and zero simulated time is right; anything else is
refused, so a job ATOM later adds to the pool is reported, not timed as free.
A service job's result reaches its coroutine at ``c_k``, through ``call_at``.

A thread serving a station job reads the clock as the job's start plus the
service charged so far (`atom.utils.clock.current_job_time`).

A frontend output thread has a width-1 detokenization station of its own:
handling one released frame is one job, from `LPRuntime.handed_over` to its
next `LPRuntime.back_at_wait_point`, charged by the `wrap_decode` calls it
makes. Callbacks it posts with ``call_soon_threadsafe`` run at its completion.
A `wrap_encode` or `wrap_decode` call on the event loop thread, such as the
final decode of a non-streaming completion, advances the LP clock instead.

`CompassEventLoop` is the frontend's event loop in a simulated run: its
``time()`` is the installed `LPRuntime`'s clock, so every timer is on LP time,
and its selector is the frontend's idle point. Idle with nothing to read, it
asks for time with `next_event`: its earliest essential timer as ``t``, its
earliest daemon timer (`DAEMON_TIMERS`) as ``t_daemon``. While a released
request is unread or a station job is open it only waits on its sockets, and
warns once, naming what it waits for, if no socket event ends that wait within
``diag_s`` wall seconds. Its select returns nothing only once ``time()`` has
reached the caller's timeout. On the ``+inf`` grant it cancels its timers and
stops. Over a clock connection with a socket, it waits for the grant and its
own sockets at once, so a request from outside the run, such as a router's
health check, is served while the grant is out; a timer that request sets
earlier than the time asked for fires at the grant. `HttpChannel` is the inline
receive of HTTP requests.
