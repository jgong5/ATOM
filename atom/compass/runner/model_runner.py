    """A `ModelRunner` that constructs without weights, KV tensors or a step.

    Everything the engine does around a step -- the scheduler, admission, the
    block manager, the prefix index -- is ATOM's own and runs unchanged. What
    this class removes is the weights, the KV tensors, the graph capture and the
    step itself, by overriding the six methods that own them; see `overrides`,
    which holds the bodies and says why each one does what it does.

    Construction is not free of device memory. Almost all of what stays
    resident is the base's forward-vars ring from `allocate_forward_vars`,
    whose dominant term is a `max_num_batched_tokens` by `hidden_size` output
    buffer; the rest is a stream, the ring's events, the attention metadata
    builder and the expert-load-balancing runtime. So the residue is O(batch
    budget x hidden size) rather than O(weights), and that dominant term is
    allocated once however deep the pipeline is: a ring slot clones the
    staging buffers and shares the one output buffer.

    Two named attributes on the runner hold that ring for the life of the
    process: `forward_vars`, the dict `allocate_forward_vars` builds, and
    `_fv_ring`, the list of per-slot dicts built from it. Both are the base's.
    What this class adds is no tensor at all: `model`, a module registering no
    parameter and no buffer; `_token_stream`, the deferral bookkeeping
    `forward` builds on first use; and `kv_pool_sizing`, the block count
    `get_num_blocks` answered, kept beside the readings it was sized from.
    Those readings come from `atom.compass.memory`, whose whole import closure
    reaches no tensor library, and `install_device_readings` puts them on the
    runner as `compass_readings`. It also sets `config.num_kvcache_blocks`,
    which is a count and not a buffer.

    `NonAllocatingRunner` comes first so its methods win over the base's. There
    is deliberately no `__init__`: the base runs all of its own before a
    subclass body would get control, so there is no point at which state set
    here would be visible to it.

    # Checked here rather than left to a deployment. The worker resolves each
    # RPC with `getattr(runner, name, None)` and skips what comes back None, so
    # a name this class stops answering -- because ATOM renamed or dropped it --
    # produces no error anywhere: the worker stays healthy and nothing logs.
    # Failing the import turns that into a worker that dies at construction,
    # with a traceback.
    #
    # The two halves below fail differently, which is why the message
    # partitions them instead of asserting one story for all twelve. A waited
    # name parks its caller on an unbounded queue read for the life of the
    # process. An unwaited one parks nobody: `busy_loop` skips it and carries
    # on -- which for `exit` means `ModelRunner.exit` never runs: the
    # distributed environment is never destroyed, `self.model` is never
    # dropped, and `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` never runs. Its five KV-tensor
    # deletions are `hasattr`-guarded and find nothing here, because this
    # runner allocated none. The loop breaks either way, since the break is a
    # sibling of the per-runner loop and tests the dispatched name rather than
    # any reply; and for `process_kvconnector_output` means a KV load is
    # silently never started. Both are real failures; neither is a park.
    #
    # Two things about this raise itself. No CPU test tier can execute it:
    # importing this module imports `ModelRunner`, which runs aiter's
    # architecture probe and needs a driver, so a green CPU gate is not
    # evidence that the composed class answers the surface -- only an import on
    # a machine with a GPU is. And when it does fire inside a worker,
    # `AsyncIOProc.__init__` resolves the runner class (`async_proc.py:166`)
    # before assigning `self.runners = []` (`:167`), so the atexit finalizer
    # then fails on the half-built object and the worker log *ends* with
    # `AttributeError: 'AsyncIOProc' object has no attribute 'runners'`. The
    # refusal is the traceback above that one.
