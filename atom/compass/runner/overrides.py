"""The model-runner methods that keep construction off the device.

These are the memory-owning methods of ATOM's `ModelRunner`: the ones that read
a checkpoint, warm the model, size the KV pool, allocate it, capture graphs, and
run a step. They live here rather than beside the subclass because this module
imports nothing from the engine at module scope, and so can be executed on a
machine with no driver.

Two of them run during construction (`_build_and_load_model`, `_maybe_warmup`)
and decline to do their work. The rest run afterwards, over the worker's RPC
channel; `allocate_kv_cache` does the arithmetic and none of the allocation,
`capture_cudagraph` captures nothing and says so in the shape its caller
unpacks, `forward` reports what a step produced without running one, and
`get_num_blocks` runs ATOM's own budget arithmetic against readings taken off a
machine spec instead of off a card.

That last one replaces no arithmetic, and the two methods beside it are the
reason it does not have to. `ModelRunner.get_num_blocks` touches the device in
exactly two calls -- `_read_device_memory` and `_estimate_cudagraph_overhead`
-- and both are override points, so replacing them leaves every line of the
budget formula, the clamp and `plan_pools` to run unchanged. A second copy of
that formula would drift from it with no test failing; a substituted reading
cannot.

Order matters when mixing this in: `NonAllocatingRunner` must precede
`ModelRunner` in the bases so these definitions win. The class deliberately
defines no `__init__`. The base class runs the whole of its own `__init__`
before a subclass body would get control, so anything these methods read has to
come from `self.config`, which the base sets first.

## The reply contract, and why it is not a matter of taste

A worker runs `AsyncIOProc.busy_loop`, which takes a name off a shared-memory
ring, resolves it with `getattr(runner, name, None)`, calls it, and forwards the
result **only when it is not None** (`atom/model_engine/async_proc.py`). The
caller's side is `AsyncIOProcManager.call_func`, whose `wait_out=True` form
blocks on `self.outputs_queue.get()` with no timeout. Three consequences, none
of which a single-process test can show:

* **A name the runner does not have is skipped, not raised.** `getattr` returns
  None, the loop moves on, the worker stays healthy, and a caller that asked for
  the reply waits for the life of the process. Absence is the quietest failure
  on this surface, which is why `RPC_SURFACE` below names every dispatched
  method rather than leaving it to whatever the class happens to inherit.
* **A method that is present and answers None parks its caller in exactly the
  same way.** This is one line below the skip, not a separate mechanism: in
  `busy_loop`, **both** of the loop's `put_nowait` calls -- the primary output
  queue and the KV queue -- are inside `if out is not None:`, just after the
  `getattr` skip. So from the caller's side an answer of None and a method that
  was never defined are one event: nothing is queued, nothing logs, and no
  timeout ends either wait.
  Naming only absence is worse than saying nothing, because it sends whoever
  is debugging the hang to check whether the method is there, find that it is,
  and stop. The shapes here are therefore checked against what the call site
  unpacks, not against what reads well -- returning None is the case a
  plausible stub falls into by accident, which is why every name on the
  surface is either replaced here or left to a base implementation that is
  known to end in a value.
* **Raising is the loud option, and it is louder in the worker than in the
  parent.** An exception leaves `busy_loop`, kills the worker, and the
  manager's process monitor turns that into a `SystemExit` on the output queue,
  which `call_func` re-raises in the caller. What crosses the boundary is the
  type and nothing else: the parent gets a bare `SystemExit()` with empty args,
  no message and no `__cause__`, so a refusal's name and its reason exist only
  on the worker's stderr. `SystemExit()` also carries `code=None`, and the
  `get_num_blocks` call in `EngineCore.__init__`
  (`atom/model_engine/engine_core.py`) sits in a `try/finally` with no
  `except`, so letting it propagate ends the parent process with status 0 -- a
  clean shutdown to any supervisor reading exit codes. So a refusal reaches the
  caller and a silence
  never does, but "reaches" means the fact of it and not the reason for it: a
  successor that wants its refusal diagnosable in the engine's own log has to
  put it there itself, on the worker side, before it raises.

The worker control commands are refused the third way: by a reply. A raise
would end the engine for a command a client sent while serving, and a None
would park it, so `RefusedControlCommands` answers each with its reason,
`command:<method>`. `busy_loop` forwards it, `EngineUtilityHandler` logs it
and, for all but `update_weights`, sends it back to the client as the
`UTILITY_RESPONSE` result; the runner also keeps every reason it answered for
the run summary's refusals.

`RPC_SURFACE` records, for each dispatched name, whether its caller waits for
the reply. The names themselves are not a list anyone typed: they are the ones
`engine_core`, `pp_engine_core` and `engine_utility` broadcast that a
`ModelRunner` answers, and the tests derive that intersection from ATOM's own
source and compare it with this table.

# one gets it, and `RefusedControlCommands` answers all seven with a refusal.
# The RapidServe names are kept out by `Config`, not by
# this module: `enable_rapidserve` picks `PrefillEngineCore` /

        The reply is the base's, forwarded unaltered, and `EngineCore.__init__`

        `num_kvcache_blocks` and `state_runtime` are subscripted, `pool_entries`

        What this adds is one record and no arithmetic. The count the scheduler
        receives is an integer with nothing attached, and most of what produced
        it is a coefficient somebody wrote down rather than a measurement of
        the card being modelled; `kv_pool_sizing` keeps the count beside the
        readings, so which terms those were is recoverable from the runner and
        not only from a log line somebody kept.

        The decode process of intra-GPU prefill/decode disaggregation is

        count of zero there, because decode imports the pool from prefill and
        owns no device memory (`RapidServeModelRunner.get_num_blocks`), and it
        holds back four safety margins on the prefill side because two
        processes share the card (`_kv_budget_extra_reserve`). Substituting
        readings into the base method reaches neither: this path would hand a
        decode process a pool it does not own.
        The base's `_kv_budget_extra_reserve` of zero is left alone for the
        same reason it is right -- the card these readings describe is a

        The base reaches the model only after it has zeroed device buffers,
        opened a graph memory pool and entered a capture context, so inheriting
        it would put bytes on a device before it discovered there are no
        weights to trace. Nothing is captured here, and the reply says exactly
        that: no seconds spent, no batch sizes captured, no pool bytes held.

        The shape is fixed by `EngineCore.__init__` and
        `DecodeEngineCore.__init__` (`atom/model_engine/engine_core.py`), which
        both write `cap_cost, bs, pool_bytes = ...` and then format the first
        and third as numbers. Returning two values, or None, is not a test
        failure over there: the worker dies on the unpack, or never replies, and
        the caller waits for the rest of its life either way.

        `capture_sizes` and `capture_sizes_np` are deliberately left at the
        eager-fallback values the base set during construction, because the
        attention metadata builder reads them on every step. The reply
        deliberately disagrees with the attribute it preserves: the base sends
        `self.capture_sizes` -- the same `[0]` -- as the second element
        (`ModelRunner.capture_cudagraph`), and this sends `[]`. Both are only
        ever formatted into a log line, and `[]` is the truthful one.

        `EngineCore.__init__` reaches this method only when `not enforce_eager
        and not disagg_is_decode`, so on an eager deployment the override never
        runs at all. Replacing it anyway is the point: a runner must not depend
        on a caller-side flag to stay off the device.

        """Report what a step produced, without running one.

        The reply is the whole of what the scheduler learns from a step, and
        `step_output` holds the three rules that decide it: the tokens belong
        to the previous output-producing batch, the lag is counted in
        output-producing steps rather than in steps, and a batch that samples
        nothing reports its requests with no tokens. Each is wrong in a way the
        scheduler accepts without complaining, so they are stated in one place
        with their reasons rather than inlined here.

        What a replacement owes its callers. These sites broadcast this name --
        `EngineCore._process_engine_step_inner` and
        `DecodeEngineCore._process_engine_step` in
        `atom/model_engine/engine_core.py`, and
        `PPEngineCoreProc._pp_head_step` (which waits and discards the reply)
        and `PPEngineCoreProc._downstream_busy_loop` in
        `atom/model_engine/pp_engine_core.py`. None of them unpacks it; the
        reply is one object, read for its attributes, and the reads are these:

        * `.req_ids`, an iterable of request ids in the batch's own order --
          `PPEngineCoreProc._pp_head_step`. That read is on the head's side of
          the transport, on what `recv_tokens()` returns, not at the
          `_downstream_busy_loop` call site, which only passes the object on.
        * `.token_ids`, `.draft_token_ids`, `.is_deferred_out`, `.logprobs`
          (None or a `dict[int, float]`) -- `Scheduler.postprocess`.
        * `.get_idx(req_id)`, returning a row index or None --
          `Scheduler.postprocess`.
        * `.num_rejected[idx]` and `.num_bonus[idx]`, indexable by that row and
          castable to `int` -- `Scheduler.postprocess`.
        * `.dspark_ell`, either None or a mapping answering `.get(seq.id)` --
          `Scheduler.postprocess`.

        Picklable on top: under pipeline parallelism the last stage sends the
        object whole (`_downstream_busy_loop`) and the head reads it back
        (`_pp_head_step`), each hop through `pickle` in
        `PPStageTransport.send_tokens` and `PPStageTransport.recv_tokens`
        (`atom/distributed/pp_transport.py`). ATOM's own answer is a
        `ScheduledBatchOutput`; the contract a replacement has to meet is these
        reads and the pickle, not that class.

        One decorator, not the base's two. ATOM's own carries
        `torch.inference_mode`, which is kept: the body no longer raises, and
        whatever a cost model eventually evaluates here should build in the
        same context as the step it stands for. It also carries
        `with_eplb_forward_monitor`, which is not. That monitor exists to
        observe how a real forward routed tokens across experts and commits a
        load window from what it saw; a predicted step routes nothing, so the
        window would be fabricated, and acting on one can move experts on a
        device this runner owns none of. A decorator is applied while the
        class body runs, so it would also have to be imported from the engine
        at module scope, which this module does not do.
        `RapidServeModelRunner`, the other runner in this tree that declines
        to own its memory, carries the same one of the two.

        No duration is reported. The reply has nowhere to put one: the engine
        times the call itself, and the batch output it reads carries tokens.
