"""The projection a cost backend is priced from: one row per scheduled request.

`BatchView` and `RequestShape` live in `atom.compass.backends` because the scan
that forbids engine imports reads that package and nothing else. This module is
their other half and does the opposite: it reads a scheduled batch, the
sequences that batch was built from, and the runner's graph-capture ladder, and
turns them into those two types. Keeping the builder here is what lets it read
the engine at all.

Two things the type cannot check, both of which belong to whoever builds the
projection rather than to whoever prices it.

**The row count.** `BatchView` states, and measures, that a one-row batch is
`tokens x history` exactly -- the collapsed form that summing per request
exists to keep out -- and that nothing in the type ties its row count to the
number of requests a scheduler scheduled. It names this module as what closes
that. So the rows here are one per entry of
`ScheduledBatch.num_scheduled_tokens`, and a `seqs` mapping whose keys are not
the batch's own `req_ids`, in the batch's own order, is refused. That refusal
is the load-bearing line in this file rather than housekeeping: `zip` is how
both structures are read everywhere else in the tree, including by
`Scheduler.compute_detailed_aggregates`, and `zip` over a mapping one request
short drops the last row in silence -- which is a shorter batch that prices
without complaining, and at two requests is exactly the collapse.

**The rung.** The type refuses a `capture_rung` with no decode rows and one
narrower than the decode row count. It cannot refuse one that is far too wide,
because rows cannot contradict a width -- only a ladder of captured widths can
-- so a width supplied by a caller is charged at face value, and one decode row
at `capture_rung=10**9` prices 99.9999999 s of graph padding. Nothing here
takes a width from a caller. `ForwardMode.decide` is the rule ATOM dispatches a
real step by, and its answer is taken whole: `running_bs` where it says a graph
replays, `None` where it says one does not. A prefill step, an eager runner and
a batch wider than the widest captured size therefore all come back `None` from
that one call rather than from three conditions restated here. `decide` finds
the width by binary search and so has a precondition -- an ascending ladder --
which is checked here rather than assumed, because an unsorted ladder answers a
width that is not the smallest captured one holding the batch, and too wide is
the direction the type cannot refuse.

**Why each row's history is read twice.** `ScheduledBatch.context_lens` is the
`N_KV` ATOM computed when it built the batch -- a prefill chunk's cached tokens
plus the chunk, a decode's whole sequence -- and is what this builds rows from.
The sequence is read for its type and for a second derivation of that same
`N_KV`, from `Sequence.num_tokens` and `Sequence.num_cached_tokens`, which is
the one `Scheduler.compute_detailed_aggregates` takes. They must agree. A
disagreement has two causes and this module cannot tell them apart by looking
at the numbers, so the refusal names both. Either the sequences handed in are
not the ones the batch was built from -- a stale or a later step's mapping --
or they are exactly those sequences and the scheduler advanced them on
purpose: `advance_on_schedule` is on whenever `pipeline_parallel_size > 1`
(`scheduler.py:994`), and `_advance_prefill_on_schedule` (`:1730`) adds each
chunk to its sequence's offsets after the batch has snapshotted them. Under
that configuration the two readings differ by a whole chunk of history on
every prefill row, and the projection refuses there instead of picking one of
the two readings.
