"""What a step reports, for a runner that predicts steps instead of running them.

ATOM's runner does not hand the scheduler the tokens of the step it was just
given. Three rules govern what it hands over instead, and each fails quietly
rather than loudly when a replacement gets it wrong.

**Tokens are one step late.** `tokenIDProcessor.is_deferred_out` is true
whenever the pipeline is a single stage, which is the ordinary case. The real
runner starts an asynchronous copy of this step's sampled ids to the host and
reports the copy the *previous* step started, so the reply carries the previous
batch's request ids and the previous batch's tokens with the deferred flag set.
`Scheduler.postprocess` is written against exactly that: it appends one
placeholder token per sequence at the end of every deferring call and
overwrites that placeholder on the next one. Reporting the current batch's
tokens with the flag clear offers them to a loop that has not yet appended a
placeholder for them, and the request is then not offered again until a later
batch happens to include it.

**The unit of that lag is one output-producing step, not one step.** The real
runner returns before sampling when the whole batch is middle chunks of chunked
prefills, so the queued copy is neither read nor replaced and the tokens of the
last output-producing step stay queued across however many middle chunks
follow. A replacement that carries its tokens forward by one *step* surfaces
them early, by the number of middle chunks in between.

**A step that produces nothing still reports its request ids.** The early
return names the batch's requests with an empty token list, and nothing reads
it on any path that exists today. A single-stage scheduler
(`Scheduler.postprocess` in `atom/model_engine/scheduler.py`) skips every
request in such a batch, on `seq.is_partial_prefill`, before it reads a token,
because they are all still mid-prompt; a pipeline head drops the entry
without waiting for a reply at all. The third path is the deferred flag, and
it has two readers above that per-seq loop: one folds it into
`need_placeholder`, and the other widens the placeholder count by one.
`need_placeholder` in turn has two uses, and both sit behind a gate -- the
prefix-hash one is inside the loop, below the same skip, and the placeholder
loop at the end touches only a sequence that is RUNNING and not mid-prefill
-- while the partial-prefill update at the top flags every member of a batch
of middle chunks partial before either gate reads it. The sequences that loop
walks are the batch's own, since `Scheduler.schedule` returns the dict it
built the batch from on both its prefill and its decode path, so this holds
for any batch rather than for the ones that have been tried.
So this one is mirrored from ATOM's own early return rather than derived from
what a caller needs -- there is no caller to derive it from, and a reply that
differs from the original differs in silence until one appears.

This module holds those rules and imports nothing from the engine, so it can be
exercised where there is no driver. It builds the keyword arguments of a batch
output rather than the object itself, for the same reason.

    A predicted step has no logits, so what a request generates is not modelled
    -- only how many steps it takes to generate it. Three readers still see the
    ids. The scheduler ends a request that emits the end-of-text id or a
    configured stop id, so either would cut every request short at its first
    token. The serving path's stream detokenizer moves its window only when the
    decoded text does not end in an incomplete character, so an id that decodes
    to part of a UTF-8 sequence holds the window open and makes detokenizing a
    stream quadratic in its length. And the prefix cache hashes generated
    blocks, chained on the prompt's: one id for every request makes two
    requests with a common prompt produce identical decode blocks, and the
    second hits the first's where a real run would not.

    So an id qualifies when it is not a stop id and decodes on its own, as the
    stream detokenizer decodes it, to ASCII letters and digits. That excludes
    every special token, which decodes to nothing there. Letters and digits
    only: whitespace and punctuation are what per-request stop strings are
