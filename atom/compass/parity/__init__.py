"""Each step's scheduling decision, recorded on a real or a simulated runner.

A simulated run reuses ATOM's scheduler, so it should build the batches a real
run builds. This records them where both runs can be read the same way, at the
model runner's `forward`: one JSON line per call, built before the call runs,
because a real forward rewrites some batch fields in place. Each line carries
the batch as the `BatchView` a simulated runner prices it from (`rows`, `rung`);
a real runner's line also carries `t_enter_ns` and `t_exit_ns`, the worker's
monotonic clock around its forward, and is written once the forward returns.
`compare` reads two records and names, per DP rank, the first step where they
part; timestamps are not part of a step's decision.

Setting `ATOM_COMPASS_PARITY_RECORD` to a directory turns recording on: TP rank 0
of each DP rank writes `dp<rank>.jsonl` there, replacing any earlier file.
Unset, nothing is recorded. The simulated runner records from
`NonAllocatingRunner.forward`; a real one records through `StepRecording`,
composed into `RUNNER`, which the frontend names on a real run with the
variable set.

A request is named by its key, because request ids are numbered per run: a
digest of its whole prompt as its prefill windows carry it, taken when its final
chunk is scheduled, so it does not move with chunking. A line records request
ids and names each request whose final chunk it holds; `read` puts the keys in.
Prefix caching is not covered: the worker never sees a cached prefix, so parity
runs need caching off or the same cache hits in both runs. Two requests of one
run with one prompt could not be told apart in either record, so the second is
refused.
