"""The Clock Authority: which waiting process may move its clock, to when, and
with which messages.

A logical process (LP) asks for time with one of two requests:

* ``TAR`` -- advance to ``t``: its owner has priced an event, and the grant is
  exactly ``t``;
* ``NER`` -- idle until ``t``, which may be ``+inf``: the grant is ``t``, its
  daemon deadline, or the earliest message registered for it, whichever comes
  first. A daemon deadline is a housekeeping timer (a metrics push, a scrape)
  that fires as usual but does not keep the run alive.

Each request carries the requester's send log since its previous request, as
``(channel, seq, arrival)``. The log is registered before the requester's state
changes, so every message an LP produced is known before its clock moves.

``N[j]`` is the earliest time LP *j* could still produce a message: its clock
while it runs, its target while it waits in TAR (its owner is inside this call
and sends nothing), and the least of its target, its daemon deadline and its
earliest unreleased message while it waits in NER. A waiting LP *i* is granted
exactly ``N[i]``, and only when ``N[i] < min over j != i of (N[j] + D(j->i))``.
``D`` is the channel table's least summed lookahead over every channel path, so
an idle LP between two others does not hide the first from the third. The comparison is strict: a
message not yet reported arrives no earlier than its sender's ``N`` plus that
distance, so a strict grant never reaches it. Waiting LPs are tried in
``(N, name)`` order and the scan restarts after every grant.

The essential horizon ``H`` is the largest TAR target, finite NER target or
registered arrival seen so far; it only grows. A waiting LP is grantable only
while ``N <= H``, so one whose ``N`` is its daemon deadline is held until some
essential time or arrival reaches that deadline. A held deadline delays no
essential grant: its ``N`` exceeds ``H``, and every essential ``N`` is at most
``H``. Because ``H`` is a function of the schedule, not of which running LP
reports first, a daemon deadline fires under every request order or none.

When every LP waits and the strict rule grants none, which only a
zero-lookahead cycle allows, the grantable LP with the least ``(N, name)`` is
granted: nothing is earlier, so nothing earlier can reach it. A message that
then lands at its receiver's current instant belongs to that instant's next
round. When every LP waits and none is grantable, nothing is undelivered and
no essential target is pending: the run is finished, every LP is granted
``+inf``, and the daemon deadlines still held never fire.

An LP may be declared with members: processes that each hold a runtime for it,
as the ranks of a data-parallel group do. A member names itself in each call,
and each channel into or out of the LP is owned by exactly one member, as the
caller declares; a member may log sends only on channels it owns. The members'
calls are joined into one request per round: each member makes the same number
of calls, all ask one kind, every TAR asks the same target, and the joined
NER's target and daemon deadline are each the least over the members. A call
before the round is complete registers its send log and nothing else: the LP
stays running, so its ``N`` stays at its clock. Every member gets the common
grant, carrying the releases on its own channels only.

A finite grant past the simulated-time bound aborts the run with the LP table.
A housekeeping timer nobody declared daemon keeps raising ``H`` and would
otherwise keep the run alive forever.

Nothing here reads a clock, opens a socket or starts a thread. The caller
carries requests in and replies out.
