"""Identity, order, channels and the grant rule for the simulated clock.

What lives here: who the participants are (`LpId`), the order they are served
in (`LpRegistry`), the channels between them with the lookahead each declares
and the path distances that follow (`ChannelTable`), the Clock Authority
that grants each one time from those distances and the messages it has
registered (`ClockAuthority`), and what a run says about itself: its timeline,
the LP table as text, and the run summary (`observability`). The transport
that carries a request to the authority, and the runtime inside each
participant, sit elsewhere.

Nothing here imports a device runtime, reads a clock, or opens a socket, which
is what makes it testable on any machine.

That claim is enforced, not asserted: every `.py` file under this package, at
any depth, is held to a standard-library allowlist and to building
no `set`. Tooling that has to read the tree, parse source, or talk to anything
therefore does not belong here even when it is about time -- put it beside the
package, not inside it. The build-time audit of ATOM's blocking calls sits in
`atom/compass/audit/` for exactly this reason.
