"""The channels between logical processes, and how far apart that puts them.

A channel is one real communication path from a sending endpoint to a
receiving endpoint, named ``src->dst:kind#inst``. Its lookahead is a floor on
the delay any message on it suffers before it takes effect on the receiver,
and its receive mode says who takes a message off it: ``thread`` when a
transport or handler thread receives and the clock owner releases each message
and waits for it to be handled, ``inline`` when the owner receives it itself.

Lookahead is per channel, not per pair of processes: a frontend and an engine
are joined by several channels, and two processes with no channel between them
have no lookahead at all -- declaring one would describe a path that does not
exist. What a grant needs is the distance ``D(j->i)``: the least summed
lookahead over every channel path from *j* to *i*, infinite when there is none.
Lookahead is static, so the distances are computed once, by Floyd-Warshall,
and again only if a channel is declared afterwards.
