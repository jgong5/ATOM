"""What a row's fingerprint is, and what a mismatch in one is allowed to say.

A fingerprint is not one digest, and there is no method here that makes one.
It is **the readings of the axes the row depends on, kept apart**, because an artifact that refuses with a single moved
hash says only that something changed, and nothing about which of six things
did. Keeping the cells apart is what lets a refusal say
`region_terms x model`, and what lets a `price_list` be shown surviving the
same change.

**A reading states what kind of thing it is, and two kinds are not compared.**
`SourceRoot.revision` holds a git *tree* on the primary path and a git
*commit* on the stamp path, so two entries published from byte-identical
source can carry different text in that field. Comparing across kinds is not
a mismatch, it is a question that cannot be asked, and the two arrive as
different refusals: `NOT_COMPARABLE` says the comparison is unavailable,
`INVALIDATED` says it was made and failed. Returning `False` for the first
would report a change nobody observed.

**The conditions are stated, never probed.** Nothing in this module reads a
device, a driver or an environment variable; a caller hands in six readings and
this module compares them, so a host with one ROCm can express a ROCm bump.
That is also why the warning flag is narrow: `OnMismatch.WARN` downgrades *the conditions moved* to a
warning, and does not touch *the comparison could not be made*, which has no
answer to downgrade.
