"""The store: a directory per entry, published once and never again.

**The store's physical form is a directory convention, with no index and no
manifest.** A key renders to a path by one total function, and the entry
restates its key, its topology, its provenance and a digest of every member
inside `entry.json`. Resolution is then arithmetic over the key rather than a
lookup, and there is no second record that can disagree with the first. The
eight incidents this package exists for are each a second statement of one fact
drifting away from it; an index is one more of those, and it is the one a store
would have to maintain on every write, so there is none. The refusal to
overwrite comes from the filesystem for free: an entry is built elsewhere and
moved into place, and a published entry is never empty -- it always carries
`entry.json` -- so `rename(2)` cannot replace one.

Stated that way on purpose, because the obvious stronger claim is false, as
measured: on ext4, `os.rename` **succeeds** onto an existing *empty* directory
and fails with ENOTEMPTY only onto a non-empty one.
The exclusivity is a consequence of what a published entry contains, not of the
rename primitive refusing an existing name -- so an entry form with no members
would inherit a silent overwrite, and an empty directory sitting in the way is
caught by the occupancy check before the rename, not by the rename. Staging is
per-publisher (`mkdtemp`) rather than a function of the key, so two publishers
at one key cannot write into each other's half-built entry.

Three refusals the convention buys, each one of those incidents:

**A handed-off entry cannot be quietly replaced.** Publishing to a key that
already has an entry is refused, and the refusal states the stored digest and
whether the incoming members are the same ones -- so a notes-only regeneration,
whose payload is bit-identical and whose digest is not, is visibly the thing it
is. The notes sit inside the digested document precisely so that changing them
changes the identity.

**Every rank of the topology is present, or nothing is published.** The
four-ranks-one-file incident wrote one name four times and left a survivor that
looked complete at 807 operators. Here a publish states its topology and its
members are checked against every rank of it, so a writer that collapses four
coordinates into one name is refused at hand-off with the three missing files
named.

**A file this store did not name cannot answer.** Every file in an entry is
read back through `naming.read_back`; a neighbour that does not parse, is not
listed, or whose digest has moved is refused by name rather than returned.

**The entry also states two things about its own validity.** A published entry carries the **fingerprint of every row
the invalidation matrix gives its kind** -- three for a `machine_spec`, whose
capacity, runtime constants and tokenizer terms are invalidated by different
things -- and the **state of every gate that shaped it**. Both are required at
publish rather than checked at load: a campaign that runs for hours and
produces an entry nobody can certify has spent the hours, and the flag that
decided the gate is not around to be asked afterwards. `read` states an entry;
`load` states it *and certifies it*, and they are two calls because the first
is how a person inspects something the second has just refused.

The flag that downgrades a mismatch to a warning lives on `load`, and it
covers the invalidation matrix and nothing else -- a gate disagreement and a
comparison that could not be made have no warning form.
