"""The artifact store: where an entry lives, what made it, and when it stops answering.

This package exists for eight incidents that share one shape -- the number was
fine and the question of *which artifact answered* was not -- turned into
refusals, plus the answer to a ninth: an artifact that is still read after the
thing it was measured against has moved.

* **A key is a tuple, never a path** (`keys`). The six artifacts and what keys
  each one; a `price_list` is `(model, width, source-root digest)`, because a
  bare or merged price file states no width and silently prices nothing.
* **One naming function** (`naming`). Write and read sides call it, per-rank
  files carry every axis's coordinates, and the suffix is applied at width one
  too -- so a width-2 read cannot answer from a width-1 neighbour.
* **Provenance names every executed source root** (`provenance`). ATOM's by the
  tree `git archive` would ship, aiter's by `git describe --tags --always
  --dirty`, the call `gate_gpu.sh:153-159` already makes. **Only the recording
  half**: the version is recorded, and what a bump *means* is the owner's
  ruling, which is not taken.
* **A handed-off entry is immutable** (`store`). **The physical form is a
  directory convention** -- no index, no manifest -- and publishing is a rename
  onto a name that must not exist, so an overwrite is impossible rather than
  discouraged.
* **Invalidation is a per-artifact matrix** (`matrix`, `fingerprints`). The
  design's table is a table in the code, so a reader can hold the two side by
  side.
  Each entry records the fingerprint of *its own dependency row* -- three rows
  for a `machine_spec` -- and a load recomputes and compares cell by cell, so a
  refusal names the cell and a change in a cell the row does not depend on
  loads clean.
* **Every gate's state is in the artifact** (`gates`). *"A dead gate is worse
  than no gate."* Loading checks the state the entry recorded, not the flag,
  which is the one thing the `PRICE_KERNELS` incident could not do.
* **Resolution names its answer** (`resolution`). A step's ledger says which
  artifacts answered it and which key missed, because `incomplete: N/2570`
  states a count and not which of two stages declined.

**Not decided here**: whether an aiter bump invalidates an artifact or only
warns (T86, filed as #168) -- until it is ruled the default stands and a bump
refuses; whether a dirty source root may publish (also #168); and what
an artifact key's scalar `width` means against a four-axis topology (#165).
The matrix's six columns hold no width, so nothing here binds one.
