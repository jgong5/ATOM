"""What names an artifact: the six artifact keys, as tuples that cannot be paths.

The table below is the whole of artifact identity. An entry is addressed by the
values that decide what it contains and by nothing else -- not by where someone
put the file, and not by a name a script composed. `price_list` is the row that
earns the rule: it is keyed by **(model, width, source-root digest)**, and a
bare or merged price file states no width, so it silently prices nothing while
looking layered.

Two refusals follow from that, and between them they are why this module
exists rather than a dict of strings.

**A field the kind does not have is refused with the kind's whole tuple.** The
most likely mistake is reaching for `path=`, and the message that helps is not
"unknown field" but "a price_list is keyed by (model, width, source_root)".

**A value that is a path is refused where it sits.** Deterministically, without
asking the filesystem: an `os.PathLike`, an absolute path, anything with a
`..` segment, or anything whose last segment ends in a data-file suffix. A
model name like `Qwen/Qwen3-32B` contains a separator and is not a path, so the
separator alone cannot be the test.

A key renders to a directory name, and the rendering is deliberately lossy --
it is a label plus a digest of the canonical key, and the entry restates its
key inside itself. The path is a place, never the authority on what lives
there.
