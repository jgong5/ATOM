"""The invalidation matrix, as a table rather than a chain of conditionals.

A global fingerprint would force re-measuring everything on a torch bump. Each
artifact records the fingerprint of **its own dependency row**, so a bump
invalidates the rows that name it and leaves the rest alone.

The table lives in `atom/compass/design/07_calibration_toolchain.md`, in the
section headed *Invalidation*. `test_the_matrix_is_the_documents_table` opens
that file by path, finds the section by its heading and parses the table
back out, so the document is a functional dependency of that test and of
nothing this module emits.

`MATRIX` below is that table transcribed, and it is deliberately a table: the
deliverable is that a reader can hold the document beside the code and check
them cell by cell. `test_the_matrix_is_the_documents_table` does the same check
mechanically, parsing the document's own rows, marks and parentheses, so the
two cannot drift.

**A uniform matrix has lost its point**, and two cells are the ones a tidying
hand would take away:

* `price_list` does **not** depend on the model. Its leaves are
  shape-parametric, and that is exactly what lets one campaign serve many
  shapes. A row that also depended on the model would make every new model a
  new pricing campaign.
* `machine_spec`'s tokenizer terms do **not** depend on the device -- they are
  host CPU work -- and its capacity does not depend on the software stack. So
  `machine_spec` is three rows here rather than one, and a device change
  invalidates two of them while a tokenizer change invalidates the third.

**Two of the seven artifacts this store holds have no row at all.**
`shape_population` and `coverage_hull` appear in the artifact key table and
nowhere in this one, and the two "sevens" are not the same seven (#174). Guessing a row for them is the failure
this package exists to prevent -- an artifact answering under conditions
nobody checked -- so `rows_for` refuses and names what is missing.
