"""The one naming function, and the coordinates a per-rank file is named by.

Two incidents, one cause. A rank-coordinate function that reported only
`{"tp": rank}` under TP=2 x DP=2 made all four ranks resolve to one
`graph.tp0.json` and write it in turn -- three quarters of the evidence
discarded and the survivor looking complete at 807 operators with no error.
And at TP=2 a calibration wrote `steps.tp0.jsonl` / `steps.tp1.jsonl` while the
run looked for `steps.jsonl`; both workers died on a bare `FileNotFoundError`
and the manager reported a SHUTDOWN signal from a DP rank in a run with no DP.

Three properties here answer them, and the third is a departure from how the
incident's own code behaved.

**A coordinate is only valid against a topology.** `RankCoords` holds the
widths it was taken in, so a coordinate that names one axis of a four-axis
topology cannot be constructed at all. The four-ranks-one-file incident needs
`RankCoords` to be constructible from `{"tp": rank}` alone, and it is not.

**Every axis appears in every name, with its width.** A suffix reads
`.dp0of2.pp0of1.pcp0of1.tp1of2`, so the name states which rank of which
topology wrote the file without a reader having to know the run. The widths
are there because the coordinates alone are not enough: rank zero of a width-1
run and rank zero of a width-2 run share every coordinate, and a name that
stated only those would let one answer for the other.

**The suffix is applied at width one too.** *"A single rank cannot expose
this, because at width one no suffix is applied"* describes the code that
failed, not a requirement. Suffixing unconditionally costs a longer name and
buys two things: the read side that drops the coordinates asks for a name no
correct writer has produced at any width; and a file can be read back into the
topology that made it, so an entry can refuse a neighbour from another run
rather than answer from it.

The parse-back exists for the same reason. A file sitting in an entry whose
name this function did not produce is refused by name rather than ignored,
because an unrecognised neighbour is exactly what the width-2 read was about to
answer from.
