"""What one deployment hands the next, and what a simulated peer may say.

A disaggregated prefill ends with a parameter blob on the producer's response.
The HTTP router does not interpret it -- it copies it onto the decode request
verbatim -- but it does refuse a prefill response that carries none, so the
blob is not optional decoration: without it there is no decode leg at all.

**The field set is not a choice.** It is re-derived from the pull backend's own
`request_finished`, which is the shape the router and the consumer were built
against, and the test beside this module parses that source rather than
trusting a copy of the list, so a field added there turns this red instead of
leaving a simulated deployment quietly one field short.

**Four of the fields name an endpoint, and a simulated deployment has none.**
The real backends fill them from the host they run on -- the machine's own
address and a port they actually bound -- which is the one answer a simulated
producer must not give: that blob names the machine running the simulation, so
anything that read it would open a connection to a real host that has no KV to
serve and no idea it was named. The answers here are the other way round --
well-formed, of the type the field carries, and impossible to mistake for a
listener:

| field | value | why it cannot be an endpoint |
|---|---|---|
| `remote_host` | `compass-simulated.invalid` | `.invalid` is reserved by RFC 2606 precisely so that it can never be delegated, so the name resolves nowhere, on any network, forever -- and it says in the name what it is |
| `remote_port` | `0` | the sockets API's own "no port": nothing listens on it, and a connection to it is refused at once rather than reaching whatever else is up on that host |
| `remote_handshake_port` | `0` | the same, for the same reason: there is no handshake because there are no two processes to hold one |
| `remote_engine_id` | `compass-simulated` | an identity, not an address. The real backends carry a constant here too -- the literal string `"None"` in both -- so nothing downstream derives a route from it |

The rest of the blob is the request's own truth and is taken from the sequence:
the block table it occupies, the parallel widths it was launched under, the
first sampled token the consumer resumes from, and the drafts and prefix-cache
hit that ride beside it.
