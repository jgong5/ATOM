"""What a KV transfer costs, and when it is therefore released.

One transfer is priced as `latency + bytes / bandwidth`, and the three terms
come from three different places on purpose.

**The bytes are exact.** A transfer moves a whole number of paged blocks, and
what one block costs is the geometry the engine was built with, not a
measurement -- so the byte count carries no error at all and nothing here
re-derives a KV layout.

**The bandwidth is a spec peak, and it is spent at the derate the spec
declares.** A datasheet number spent as an achievable one would make every
transfer faster than any wire has ever been. The schema obliges a derate
wherever a peak appears and refuses a document that omits one, so this module
reads both and multiplies; it re-checks nothing.

**The latency and the bandwidth are named per side of the node boundary**, and
the caller says which side it is on. There is no default and no fall back to
the other side: a transfer between two nodes priced on the intra-node link is
wrong by roughly an order of magnitude and would look entirely plausible.

Two things this model is not.

It is **unvalidated**. No real RDMA baseline has been fitted to it, so the
latency and bandwidth in a spec are declarations rather than measurements, and
a predicted transfer time inherits that. Fitting them is a calibration
exercise against a real deployment; until then the numbers are as good as the
document they came from and no better.

It charges the same duration to both ends of the same wire. A push and a pull
of the same blocks cost the same here, which is a claim about the fabric being
symmetric that this model cannot check.

Nothing in this module imports the engine or a tensor library. Reaching it
through the package around it is not the same import: `atom.compass.kv` loads
the connector beside it, and that brings the engine's connector interface and
its factory -- seven modules, measured, none of them a tensor library and none
of them a device runtime. So the arithmetic still runs where no driver does,
which is the property worth having; it is not a bare import of this file.
