"""The per-process bootstrap of a simulated run: which LP a process is, and its clock.

A run is on when `ENV` names a run file, a JSON object every process of the
deployment reads; spawned processes inherit it. The API server's
``--compass-run`` sets it. With it unset, every function here returns at once
and ATOM runs as it always does.

One engine LP at one stage, one frontend LP, and the traffic LP the harness
drives, over `single_engine_table`. At data-parallel width above one, each DP
rank's engine process is a member ``dp<rank>`` of the one engine LP and owns
its rank's channels. The Clock Authority is co-hosted in the frontend's
process and served at the run file's ``clock_endpoint``, which every LP and
member, the frontend's included, connects to.

- `frontend(config)` wraps the `CoreManager` construction in `LLMEngine`: it
  selects the simulated runner, serves the authority and installs the
  frontend LP's runtime; leaving it, after READY from every engine, starts
  the run.
- `engine(config)` wraps the engine's construction in its own process the
  same way, and maps every DP rank to the engine LP for the process-group
  check.
- `runner(runner)` installs the cost backend and the device readings on a
  `CompassModelRunner` where it would build its model, in the worker process.
- `tokenizer(tokenizer, config)` charges the served tokenizer's ``encode`` and
  ``decode`` to the frontend's clock, at the rates the machine spec measured.
- `engine_done(engine)` and `frontend_done(engine)` close each side after the
  finish, each handing in its LP's refusals; the frontend's, when it co-hosts
  the authority, then writes the step table and the run summary.

Run file keys: ``clock_endpoint``, ``bound_s`` (finite), ``admission_path``,
``ipc_s``, ``stream_s``, ``coefficients`` (a `Coefficients` mapping, priced by
`ShapeStubBackend`) or ``law`` (a `CoarseLaw` mapping, priced by `CoarseBackend`),
``machine`` (a machine spec mapping), ``parameter_count``, and ``out_dir``,
where the step table, the run summary and each server LP's refusals go: an
engine's are the worker's refused commands and the engine's refused clock
calls, a frontend's its executor's refused jobs and its refused clock calls.
Each engine's worker writes the memory it predicts there too, for
``python -m atom.compass.memory.check``. The authority removes an earlier
run's files there as it starts. An optional ``data_parallel_size``, 1 when
absent, is the deployment's DP width, which under DP-attention is its TP size
times its DP size; the traffic LP reads the channel table from the run file
alone. Each DP rank's engine process hands in its own refusals, as
``<lp>.<member>``.

A run file that also has ``router_s`` and ``kv_write_req_s`` describes a
prefill-decode run over `prefill_decode_table`, and ``kv_link`` (``intra_node``
or ``inter_node``) names the link its KV transfers are priced on. A deployment
whose ``kv_connector`` is ``compass`` is its prefill (``kv_producer``) or
decode side: `engine(config)` makes it the ``engine-P`` or ``engine-D`` LP and
binds the connector's transfer model. The write-request address comes with the
deployment's own ``kv_transfer_config``. `frontend(config)` refuses such a
deployment unless the authority is standalone: a prefill-decode run spans two
API servers that must share one.

The API server's ``--compass-clock-endpoint`` sets `CLOCK_ENV`: the authority
is not co-hosted but served by `authority`, its own process started before the
engines (``python -m atom.compass.run``), and every LP connects to that
endpoint. Its frontend is ``frontend-P`` or ``frontend-D`` by ``kv_role``. The
standalone authority writes the step table and the run summary once every
server LP has handed in its refusals, which the out_dir both API servers share
carries.
