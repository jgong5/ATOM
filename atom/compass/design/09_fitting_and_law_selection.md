# ATOM Compass — Design Topic 9: Fitting and Law Selection

**Status:** reviewed and approved, 2026-09-20. Drafted by an AI assistant during a design
interview and reviewed by jgong5 across two review rounds on PR #3. No code has been
written against it yet; implementation follows the execution plan in `16`.

**Depends on:** `07_calibration_toolchain.md` (the measurements being fitted),
`04_model_capture_and_cost_ir.md` (the leaves a law prices).

**Scope.** How measurements become a model: objective, feature construction, outlier
handling, guards, and how a functional form is chosen and shown to be right. This is a
separate concern from the toolchain that produces the data and from the protocol that
judges the result.

**Why it needs its own document.** Nearly every wrong number in the prior effort came from
a fitting decision, not a measurement error — the measurement was usually fine. Four
distinct failures: an objective that weighted by magnitude, a feature computed against the
wrong rectangle, a guard that could not see a hole, and a family validated by a method that
cannot validate families.

## D53. Fit relative error, not absolute seconds

### The failure

Ordinary least squares on squared seconds makes a 250 ms sample count roughly **60×** a
32 ms one. The symptom was diagnostic and almost invisible: widening the sweep to cover
decode rungs 32–64 added large prefill samples, dropped the share of sub-1024-token prefill
steps from **17% to 9%**, doubled the median token count to **13,008** — and moved the
512-token prediction from **−13% to −17%**, *against a measurement that did not move*
(32.51 → 32.53 ms).

> **An unweighted fit is a weighted average whose weights are the sample values.** Adding
> evidence in one region degraded prediction in another, which is not something a coverage
> check can catch.

### Decision

**Every equation is divided by its own target before fitting, and the MAD outlier test runs
on the same relative residuals.**

| prefill prediction | absolute fit | relative fit | measured |
|---|---|---|---|
| at 512 tokens | −11.8% | **−5.3%** | 32.53 ms |
| at 2512 tokens | +18.3% | **+3.9%** | 43.78 ms |
| median over 121 rows | 9.51% | **9.03%** | |

---

## D54. What is fitted separately

**Prefill and decode are separate fits.** Prefill is compute-bound in new tokens; decode is
bandwidth-bound in KV history. Total context is **summed** across the batch, never
averaged.

**Decode is fitted per CUDA-graph rung, with *both* coefficients per rung:**

| decode model | median \|err\| | RMSE | worst region |
|---|---|---|---|
| `[1, batch, total_context]` | 5.04% | 0.4216 ms | −3.7% |
| per-rung intercept, shared slope | 8.09% | 0.3952 ms | −12.6% |
| **per-rung intercept and slope** | **0.93%** | **0.1259 ms** | **−1.3%** |

In place over 2,174 measured decode steps: **0.73% median**, per rung 0.46 / 0.45 / 0.69 /
1.67 / 2.11 / 1.57 / 0.25 / 0.37% for rungs 1 → 64.

### A sign that was wrong, not merely a curve that was

**Decode cost *falls* as batch grows.** At matched total context over 1,662 decode steps:

| batch | 1 | 2 | 4 | 8 | 12 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| TP=1 | 3.640 | 3.564 | 3.393 | 3.317 | 3.532 ms |
| TP=2 | 3.636 | 3.563 | 3.403 | 3.351 | 3.310 ms |

Twelve sequences cost *less* per step than one. A model assuming monotone growth in batch
is wrong in direction, not just in magnitude.

---

## D55. Feature construction

```
prefill:  [ 1,  tokens,  Σ_req N_Q²,  Σ_req N_Q·(ctx − N_Q) ]
decode:   [ 1,  batch,   Σ ctx ]
per rung: [ 1,  Σ ctx,   rung·max(ctx) − Σ ctx ]
```

Two constructions are load-bearing and both were originally wrong.

**1. Attention terms are summed per request**, not computed from batch-collapsed scalars.
Collapsing the batch to `tokens × history` and multiplying was a rank deficiency. ATOM
already computes the correct form: `ScheduledBatch.detailed_sqsq / detailed_sqsk /
detailed_sk` are **Σ N_Q², Σ N_Q·N_KV, Σ N_KV**, produced by `compute_detailed_aggregates`
(`scheduler.py:2788-2841`).

**2. The padding term is the *rung's* rectangle, not the batch's.** `rung·max(ctx) − Σctx`,
**not** `len(ctx)·max(ctx) − Σctx`. Error tracked the ratio between them exactly:

| rung | ratio | error with the wrong rectangle |
|---|---|---|
| 2 | 1.00 | −0.34% |
| 8 | 1.40 | −2.41% |
| 4 | 2.26 | −3.91% |
| **16** | **5.59** | **−22.64%** |

---

## D56. A rank deficiency is not a coverage gap

### The failure, and how it hid

Decode error at rungs 8 and 16 was diagnosed as missing evidence. It was not — it was **a
column of zeros where a feature should be**. Every calibration round ran sequences of one
length, so raggedness was exactly **1.00 in all 2,997 samples**. Filling the *context* gap
moved rung 8 from **−32.6% to −32.1%**. Adding ragged rounds plus the padding feature took
it to **−7.4%**.

### And the second-order trap

> **A wrongly-computed feature reads as an unconstrained one.**

Two rounds of sweep changes were spent on the theory that the padding coefficient was
unconstrained. It was constrained — it was fitted to the wrong number (D55). The symptom
worth remembering: **widening the evidence twice moved rung 16 by 0.07 points.**

### Decision

Before concluding "we need more samples", check the design matrix:

1. **Any feature with no variance in the samples is dropped and its coefficient returned as
   zero**, explicitly, in the fit's description — never silently absorbed into the
   intercept.
2. **Report the condition number and the per-feature variance** with every fit.
3. **If widening the evidence does not move the error, the feature is not unconstrained —
   it is wrong.** That is a diagnostic rule, not a heuristic.

---

## D57. Outliers, and what a fit must report

- **MAD rejection on relative residuals, then refit.** The number dropped is reported in
  the fit's description, never silently.
- **A fit's description names its provenance** (`07` terminology), its sample count, the
  dropped count, the condition number, and the hull it is valid over.
- **Report an interval or report nothing.** A difference smaller than ~5% needs repeats
  before it means anything, and repeats must be spaced (`08` D45).

---

## D58. Guards: refuse, and use a hull

### Refuse rather than fall back

An oracle asked about a step kind it has no samples of **raises**. The prior fallback was
the mean of an empty list — zero — producing *"a confident, precise, entirely fictional
answer"*: a TTFT of **0 ms against a real 7.6 s**.

### The extrapolation guard must see the joint distribution

A per-feature guard **cannot see a hole**. The concrete case: batch 8 was covered (1–16
seen), context ~2,650 was covered (57–41,052 seen), and nothing warned — but the sweep's
batch-8 steps run 1,776–2,288 and then jump to 5,360. *"The query sits in a hole, and the
guard reported it as interpolation."*

This cost **three** iterations to abandon:

1. context bounds hid a gap — rung 8's bounds `[264, 327168]`, a step at 33,045 inside them
   *and* inside a gap; 117/117, 512/512 and 1,642/1,642 real steps fell in the hole
2. raggedness bounds hid a gap
3. rung 16 was covered on both axes **separately** and still came out **22.6% low**, holding
   64 samples at raggedness exactly 1.00 against a run at 1.18–1.32

**Decision: a convex hull or k-NN distance with a threshold, never a per-feature bounding
box.** The k-NN oracle already computes the distance.

And the dimensions are **workload-dependent** — 0.6B batches ran at raggedness 2.82–3.85,
27B at 1.11–1.42 — so:

> **"The sweep covers this" is a statement about a pair, never about a sweep alone.**

---

## D59. Law selection, and why leave-one-out cannot do it

### The failure

Attention cost was fitted as a power law `a·L^p` on three geometrically spaced lengths:
LOO median **0.75%**, worst 1.08%. Two independently traced graphs at 3,194 and 6,594 then
came in at **−6.2% and −6.7% — the same direction**. Cross-run repeatability is 0.2%, so
this was model bias, not noise.

> **LOO perturbs the sample; it does not test the family.** Where a sample is small and
> geometrically spaced, LOO reports how stable the fit is, not whether the family is right.

### What the data actually looked like

A dense 13-point ladder (2,294 → 10,094 in steps of 600) shows cost per token sitting on
**flat plateaus**: 3.67, 6.28, 6.10, 5.90, 6.01, 8.31, 8.45, 8.17, 8.22, 10.58, 10.41,
10.47, 10.50 µs/token. Four plateaus, steps of ~2.27 µs/token, plateau index
`ceil(L / 2530)`.

**The quadratic term is computed in whole chunks of keys** — attention is quantised in
sequence length. `f(L) = L·(a + b·ceil(L/S))` with a = 1.461 µs, b = 2.272 µs, S = 2530
gives LOO median **1.59%** against 7.78% for the power law, and predicts the independently
traced graphs to **0.13%, 0.62%, 1.21%**.

### And it still does not survive batching

`2×3194` is **+23.9%**. Tracing 3,194 at one and two sequences: **19.967 ms/seq at one,
15.470 ms/seq at two** — a 22.5% drop per sequence from adding a neighbour, while the same
comparison moves 2.8% at 2,294 and 0.9% at 4,694.

> The chunking is a property of the **batch**, not the sequence.

### Decision

1. **A family is validated on independently obtained data, never by LOO.** LOO ranks
   candidates within a family; a held-out measurement decides the family.
2. **Rank at least three candidate laws** and report all of them with their held-out error,
   not only the winner. The prior tool ranked five.
3. **A law that fits one axis must be tested on a second** before it ships — the batching
   test above is the pattern, and so is the rotary-buffer formula that matched the 0.6B
   exactly and was **4× wrong** on the 27B. *Tested on a second model, failed, did not
   ship.*

---

## D60. Cost is piecewise; interpolation is not sound-but-imprecise

### The cliffs are real and reproducible

**GEMM tile cliff.** One gemm at 20 values of M: flat at ~9.2 µs to M=12, then climbing,
then **jumping 58.07 µs at M=768 → 137.45 µs at M=1024 where the trend says ~77**. Each
signature already records which kernels it launched: M=256/384 → `MT128x1…`; 512/768 →
`MT256x1…`; 1024 → `MT256x2…`. **The price list already knows the band.**

**Prefill is non-monotone in token count, reproducibly** (five repeats each, tight to a
tenth of a percent):

| shape | tokens | step |
|---|---|---|
| 8×100 | 3,952 | 55.32 ± 0.07 ms |
| 4×200 | 4,376 | 63.16 ± 0.02 ms |
| 2×400 | 4,588 | **52.14 ± 0.03 ms** |
| 1×800 | 4,694 | 65.13 ± 0.05 ms |

Two independent causes: a gemm tile cliff (M=4,376 at 536.80 µs `MT256x224x64` against
M=4,500 at 259.68 µs `MT256x192x64`) and attention's quadratic. And the extreme case: at
~9–10k tokens, **one long sequence costs 174.5 ms where four shorter ones totalling 9,176
tokens cost 100.3 ms — 74% more time for 10% more tokens.**

### What interpolation measures

| measured shapes | n | median | worst |
|---|---|---|---|
| every other shape | 10 | 5.5% | **57.8%** |
| powers of two | 11 | 2.8% | **60.1%** |
| 1, 8, 64, 512 | 4 | 3.7% | **64.7%** |
| 1, 32, 1024 | 3 | 8.6% | **80.1%** |

And the obvious guard — interpolate only between same-kernel neighbours — **refuses almost
everything**: twelve distinct tile configurations across twenty M values, so 8 of 10
held-out shapes have no same-kernel bracket. The two that do come out at 0.4%.

> **Interpolation is not sound-but-imprecise; it is accurate most of the time with no way to
> tell when it is not. For a tool whose output is a ranking of configurations, an occasional
> silent 60% is worse than a uniform 10%.**

Prefill steps do not interpolate either, even averaged over hundreds of kernels: median
**12.2%**, worst **32.1%**, against 2.1% for a measured ladder.

### Decision

**Laws are piecewise over declared dispatch bands.** A band boundary is read from the
recorded kernel identity, not inferred from a residual. A query between bands with no
bracket **refuses** rather than interpolating.

## D61. Declared treatments

A treatment is a factor that moves cost and is **invisible to every feature in the model**.
It must be declared and the calibration population matched to the target, or the fit is
silently averaging over it.

**Known treatment: decode row order.** At one fixed 32-row context multiset, row order
alone moves measured decode attention across **1.77×** — grouped-descending 276.1 µs,
grouped-ascending 292.2 µs, alternating 376.5 µs, ladder-interleaved 489.5 µs. Refuted as
causes: KV pool footprint (2.42× pool maximum moves the price −0.5%), co-residency, shape,
and launch-wave packing.

> Every feature in every candidate law — `crit_waves`, `work_waves`, `launch_waves` — is a
> function of the context multiset, so all four orders are the same vector. **No
> coefficient over that basis can separate them, and a corpus that mixes orderings is
> fitting an undeclared treatment.**

Consequence, already in `07` D39: calibration batches are **replayed** from the real
scheduler's step table, with explicit `block_tables`. Hand-built ladders are grouped by
construction.

**Suspected treatments to check before fitting:** raggedness (workload-dependent, and it
was a zero column for 2,997 samples), cached fraction, and the prefill chunk's position in
its streak.

---

## D62. Two biases that must be modelled or excluded, not left to cancel

**1. Leading warmth does not transfer, and charging it is wrong.** The 27B sweep's first
three prefill steps cost **47.5 / 19.5 / 6.1 s** at 8 / 32 / 96 tokens where the same shapes
later cost **0.11 s**. Replaying that onto a simulated run's first step gives **+31.03%** on
the prefill total against a real cold start of 6.87 s. *"A server does a profile run and
captures graphs before its first measured step, so most of the process-level warmth is
spent by then; a sweep meets it head-on."*

**Decision:** the fit **measures and reports** its leading warmth and charges nothing
(`leading warmup in table = 3 steps totalling 72.80 s, not charged`). A per-deployment
`warmup_seconds` constant defaults to 0 — measured at 6.68 s on 27B TP=4 (steady to 1.3%
over four repeats), 0.01 s on the 0.6B.

**2. The prefill bias is shape-dependent, so scaling cannot fix it.** Split by the history
each chunk attends over:

| history band | chunks | error |
|---|---|---|
| 16k–50k | 44 | −1.16% |
| 50k–100k | 50 | +3.74% |
| 100k–150k | 11 | **+13.36%** |

Not extrapolation — the sweep has 16 samples in that band and reaches 258k. *"It is a
balance problem: 77% of the sweep sits in 16k–50k, the workload never goes past 131k, and
one linear coefficient is fitted across the whole range."*

**Decision:** report error **stratified by the axes the law is linear in**, not only in
aggregate. A single coefficient across a range the workload samples unevenly is a design
choice that must be visible.
