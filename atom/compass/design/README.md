# ATOM Compass — Design

**Status: reviewed and approved, 2026-09-20. Design only — no code has been written
against it yet.** Every document carries a matching header. **109 decisions — D0–D94
with no gaps, plus 14 sub-decisions** — are indexed at the end of this file; **81 registered
TODOs — T1–T80 and T82, of which 76 are open** (T10, T15, T22 and T48 are struck through as
done, and T77 was opened and closed by P0.1); they, the load-bearing assumptions and the
cross-cutting issues live in **`12_open_items.md`**. Implementation follows the execution
plan in `16`.

## What Compass is

A performance simulator for ATOM. It answers one question:

> **For this model, this parallelism, and this workload — what latency and throughput, and
> does it fit in memory?**

Memory is part of the question, not an afterthought: it decides which configurations exist
at all, and predicting the speed of a configuration that cannot start is answering the
wrong question.

## The one idea that explains all the others

> **Compass replaces only the forward pass.**

ATOM's real scheduler, real block manager, real admission logic and real prefix cache all
run unchanged. A simulated run therefore makes **the same scheduling decisions** as a real
one; it only substitutes a predicted duration for the work.

Almost every decision in these documents follows from taking that literally.

---

## Design principles

Inherited from the task, and every decision in these documents is traceable to one of them.
Where a decision looks odd, it is usually principle 1 or 2 being applied literally.

| # | Principle | Where it bites |
|---|---|---|
| **1** | **Reuse ATOM's API server and scheduling modules.** Replace only the model layer and the modules it depends on (KV cache management, communication). Modify or refactor the reused parts where discrete time requires it — but do not reimplement them. | `01` D1 keeps ATOM's whole multi-process topology rather than collapsing it. `03` D13 refuses to simulate the KV pool. `07` Phase 0 forbids re-deriving admission to get shapes. |
| **2** | **Simulated execution touches no GPU.** No compute, no device allocation. Compute capability, memory size, bandwidth and interconnect are **configured**, never read from a device runtime. | `05` exists at all. `03` D14 substitutes the five device readings. `04` D18 captures under `FakeTensorMode`. |
| **3** | **Prioritise simplicity.** Add only what is necessary, and nothing more. | `02` D11: the runner has no modes. `01` D4: ~20 of ~55 synchronization sites are deliberately left alone. |
| **4** | **Prefer clean abstractions and refactoring over ad-hoc changes.** | `02`'s `CostBackend` boundary, which forbids ATOM imports. `05` D24 pushes thread-pool width into ATOM's config rather than Compass's. |
| **5** | **Start small; cut work into stages that are individually verifiable.** | M1's fake model exists to validate the clock, the KV path and the harness *before* any real cost model. |
| **6** | **Refuse rather than fall back.** A declined answer with a named reason is a result. A guessed one is a defect. | Everywhere. The archetypal failure is in *Conventions* below. |

Two more that the evidence added, and that are not in the original brief:

| # | Principle | Why it was added |
|---|---|---|
| **7** | **Never report an aggregate without its decomposition.** | Aggregates have hidden compensating errors here at least six times. See finding 2. |
| **8** | **Every claim carries its measurement.** A number without a source is a defect. | Several "known" constants turned out to be one data point. |

---

## Scope: what is simulated, what is reused, what is stubbed

The single most important table here, and the one most easily got wrong. "Compass replaces
only the forward pass" is a statement about *decisions*, not about tensors — several things
ATOM's real code owns still never touch a device.

| Component | Status | What that means concretely |
|---|---|---|
| **Forward pass** | **SIMULATED** | No kernels run. `CompassModelRunner.forward` evaluates a cost model and returns a predicted duration plus a correctly-shaped `ScheduledBatchOutput`. `02` D10 |
| **Model weights** | **STUBBED** | Constructed on meta/fake tensors for geometry; no checkpoint bytes are read and nothing is resident on a device. `02`, and see `12_open_items.md` M-c |
| **KV cache *tensors*** | **STUBBED** | `allocate_kv_cache` is a no-op. No device bytes are allocated. `03` D13 |
| **KV block accounting** | **REUSED, unmodified** | `BlockManager`, `BlockPool`, the prefix index, `plan_pools`, ref counting, eviction, preemption. It is pure arithmetic over integers, so running the real thing is *more* faithful than simulating it, and free. `03` D13 |
| **KV *transfer* (PD disagg)** | **SIMULATED** | No RDMA, no real bytes on a fabric. A simulated connector registered in ATOM's existing factory charges `latency + bytes/bandwidth` from the machine spec. `01` D6 |
| **Prefix caching** | **REUSED, unmodified** | The hit *is* ATOM's hit, at ATOM's 64-token block granularity. Its effect on prefill cost is a cost-model term, not an inference. `03` |
| **Scheduler / admission / chunking** | **REUSED, unmodified** | The whole point. Same decisions as a real run. `01`, `03` |
| **API server, tokenizer** | **REUSED, real** | Real HTTP, real uvicorn, real tokenizer — run for its *effect*, with a modelled duration charged for its *time*. `06` D33 |
| **Device memory readings** | **SUBSTITUTED** | Five readings come from the machine spec instead of the runtime, so an MI308X host can model an MI355X. The budget *arithmetic* around them is ATOM's. `03` D14, `05` |
| **Wall-clock time** | **SUBSTITUTED** | Business-logic clock reads come from the Clock Authority. Failure detectors and metrics-push cadence deliberately stay real. `01` D5, `11` D72 |
| **Collectives / comms** | **SIMULATED** (cost only) | Priced from measurements or the spec; no collective actually runs on a device. `07` D40 |
| **Atomesh router** | **REUSED, untouched** | Zero changes. The simulated timeline rides `kv_transfer_params`, which the router already relays verbatim. `06` D30 |
| **Serving *decisions*** | **NOT MODELLED** | Compass predicts the time decisions consume, not the decisions themselves — because it reuses the code that makes them. *(A simple serving simulation is planned as a future part of Compass; explicitly out of scope for this work.)* |

**The rule underneath the table:** anything that is *arithmetic* is reused; anything that is
*a device* is substituted or stubbed. The KV pool is the clearest case of the first and the
one most often assumed to be the second.

### Not modelled at all

Fragmentation. Neighbour contention. A device that has never been measured (except at
tier-0 fidelity). See **Scope and non-goals** below for where each is recorded.

## Architecture

Four views. **A** shows where Compass sits inside ATOM; **A2** is Compass alone, layered;
**B** follows one step; **C** splits offline from online; **D** is the cost-tier stack.

```

**Yes, the Clock Authority is a Compass component.** It ships in Compass, it is started by
Compass, and it has no meaning in a real ATOM run. It deploys two ways from one
implementation — co-hosted in the API-server process by default, standalone for the
multi-container M4/M6 cases (`01` D3.3).

The seam needs **no ATOM change**: `Config.runner_qualname` already exists and already has
two in-tree users.

### A2. Compass alone, layered

Every component in the detailed design documents appears here exactly once, with the
document that owns it. Nothing in `01`–`11` is outside this diagram.

Wall-clock time passes while that HTTP round trip happens. **Virtual time does not** — it
advances only for durations the cost model produced.

   |  machine_spec   price_list     |  JIT  |  memory model -> blocks   |
   |  op_graph       region_terms   | trace |                           |
   |  memory_readings coverage_hull |       |  -> simulated run         |
   +--------------------------------+       +---------------------------+
```

Artifacts are keyed, digested and fingerprinted; a stack or source change **refuses**
rather than answering from stale data.

### D. The three cost tiers

```
  +-------------------------------------------------------------+
  |  tier b   op-level empirical                                 |
  |           symbolic IR + priced leaves + region terms         |
  |           needs: a calibration campaign                      |
  |           used for: acceptance cells                         |
  +-------------------------------------------------------------+
  |  tier a   coarse empirical                                   |
  |           fitted over features ScheduledBatch already carries|
  |           needs: measured steps                              |
  |           used for: structure discovery, sweeps, plumbing    |
  +-------------------------------------------------------------+
  |  tier 0   analytic / roofline                                |
  |           machine spec + model geometry ONLY                 |
  |           needs: nothing                                     |
  |           used for: day one; a device never measured         |
  +-------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Orthogonal to the tier, every individual answer carries its **provenance** — measured,
fitted, interpolated, extrapolated or analytical — and a step reports the mixture.

## Acceptance targets

| Requirement | Target |
|---|---|
| Throughput prediction | error ≤ 10% |
| Time per output token (TPOT) | error ≤ 10% |
| Time to first token (TTFT) | error ≤ 10% |
| Each non-KV memory term | error ≤ 10% |
| KV capacity / block count | **error ≤ 5%** |
| Generalization | predict beyond the configurations used for calibration |
| Simulation speed | aim ≥ 5×; negotiable, but **faster than a real run** is the floor |

Tier 0 has its own, looser, separately-declared goals, with **configuration ranking** as
its primary gate rather than latency error (`10` D67.1).

Final proof is **paired simulated and real execution of cc-traces proper**.

### Milestones

| # | Milestone |
|---|---|
| **M1** | Fake models covering prefill, decode, KV need and TP/DP/PP/EP; the discrete-event foundation; the test harness; PD aggregation and disaggregation driven by the cc-traces harness |
| **M2** | Qwen3.8-27B on MI308X-class hardware, PD aggregation, **TP1** |
| **M3** | Qwen3.8-27B, same hardware, **TP2 and TP4** |
| **M3.5** | **Speculative decoding / MTP** mechanism on Qwen3.8-27B: structures, shapes, draft KV, declared acceptance (`14`) |
| **M4** | Qwen3.8-27B, same hardware and TP configs, **PD disaggregation across two nodes** |
| **M5** | Kimi-K3, same hardware, **TP8**, PD aggregation |
| **M6** | Kimi-K3, **TP8, PD disaggregation** |
| **M7** | Kimi-K3 with **DP, PP and EP** |

Sequencing, dependencies and parallelisable work are in the execution plan (`16`). `00_initial_prompt.md` is the original seed and is
**not** a design document — see *Development history*.

## Scope and non-goals

Stated here so they are not discovered at review.

| Not in scope | Where it is recorded |
|---|---|
| A device that has never been measured — except at tier-0 fidelity, which is derate-dominated | `10` D69 |
| Neighbour contention. Compass models a **dedicated** device, so it will not predict an OOM a shared box produces | `03` D14 |
| Memory fragmentation — not modelled, not planned, and nobody models it | `03` D16 |
| **Cancellation** — `status` is `"completed"` on all 1,697 subagent wrappers in both corpora. There is nothing to replay. | `06` D35 |
| Serving *decisions* as a simulated subsystem — a simple serving simulation is planned for a later phase of Compass, not this one | — |

One thing that **is** in scope and is worth stating as a limit rather than a non-goal:

- **Predicting what acceptance rate a speculative draft head will achieve.** Speculative
  decoding and MTP *are* in scope (`14`), but acceptance is a behaviour Compass cannot
  compute — it is a **declared input**, like device bandwidth. A speculative throughput
  result is conditional on that input and the artifact says which tier it came from
  (`14` D83, D87).

### In scope, and worth naming because they are easily assumed otherwise

- **Speculative decoding and MTP.** Now topic `14`. Three of the four things it changes are
  routine — more structures, a `K+1`-token query per sequence, two extra memory terms — and
  the fourth, acceptance, is handled by ATOM's existing `--spec-decode-acceptance-*`
  mechanism rather than by anything Compass builds.
- **Closed-loop arrivals.** These *are* reproduced (`06` D35) and the clock contract makes
  them work: the harness holds a clock client and its pacing is a Clock Authority call, so
  a closed-loop replay runs against the global virtual timeline. What is genuinely
  *reconstructed rather than recorded* is the **join**: no field in the corpus says a parent
  resumed because a child finished, so the harness imposes SPAWN/JOIN linkage. That is a
  fidelity caveat on the workload, not a scope exclusion.
- **Asymmetric parallelism (EP, PP, DP).** M7 names all three, so they are in scope. There
  is no design for them yet; that is a **gap**, recorded as `12` M-d, to be written before
  M7 starts rather than deferred indefinitely.

---

## Load-bearing assumptions

Five assumptions hold up large parts of the design. **One has been tested** — T10, resolved
by P0.3 on 2026-09-20; the other four have not. Each now carries a named check, a place it
runs, and a cost — in **`12_open_items.md` §1**, so they are schedulable work rather than
caveats.

| # | Assumption | If false |
|---|---|---|
| **T21** | The in-situ calibration transfers across TP width | the "calibrate at TP1, predict TP2/4/8" recipe collapses. Overhead constants have **already** been measured moving 12% and 7% in *opposite directions* between TP1 and TP2 on the same GPUs. |
| **T25** | The real-vs-real noise floor stays narrow under closed-loop replay at high client count | those cells become ungradeable. All prior data is 20 requests, one session, declared arrivals. |
| **T5** | ATOM's model classes trace cleanly under `FakeTensorMode` at TP>1 | tier b has no IR, and docs `04`, `07`, `09` rest on it |
| **T52** | `TorchDispatchMode` instrumentation does not hang ATOM at width | capture is unusable at TP>1; gates T5. A mode-induced 8-rank hang already exists in-tree and is being root-caused, not worked around. |
| ~~**T10**~~ | ~~`AgenticReplayStrategy` can be subclassed rather than vendored~~ — **resolved 2026-09-20 by P0.3: yes, and nothing is vendored** | the ~2,000-line consequence does not occur. What the spike found instead is that a subclass reaches only four of the nine pacing calls, so the adapter rebinds the runner's `LoopScheduler` (`06` D34.1) |

**Order to settle the four that remain:** T52 → T5 → T21, T25. T10 came first — an hour, no
hardware, largest swing per hour — and is done. The last two are designed-in steps of the
calibration and validation flows, not extra work — but they can each invalidate an
acceptance claim, so they should not drift to the end.

## Development history

Two prior attempts exist on this repository, and the measurements quoted throughout these
documents come from them.

| Branch | Relationship | What it contributed |
|---|---|---|
| `feature/atomcompass_take2` | the pruned PoC baseline; equals PR jgong5/ATOM#2 | the seam, the arrival field, the provenance vocabulary, the first cc-traces pilots |
| `feature/atomcompass` | **not** an earlier abandoned attempt — it is take2 plus ~350 commits | the calibration campaign, the memory evidence, the op-pricing method, and every failure mode listed in *Five findings* |
| `feature/atomcompass_new` | this branch, a clean fork of upstream `main` | design only, so far |

**This is a fresh design.** The prior work is referred to at the level of *design*, never as
a code-port plan: where a prior mechanism is the right answer it is re-derived on its
merits; where it is not, it is not carried. What *is* inherited wholesale is the evidence —
roughly forty measurements, most of which were got wrong once before they were got right,
and which is why several decisions here look more defensive than a first design would.

`00_initial_prompt.md` is preserved as the **original seed**: the task as first written,
sketchy and partly superseded. It is not a design document and is not normative. Where it
disagrees with a design topic, the design topic wins.

---

## Five findings that shaped everything

Anyone reading one section should read this one.

1. **Aggregate cost accuracy does not bound schedule accuracy.** A prior run was within
   **1.0% on prefill seconds, 1.1% on decode, 1.0% on run length — and 90% wrong on median
   TTFT**, because TTFT hung on two comparisons with 1.5 s and 1.2 s of slack. Hence `08`
   D44's three separable results.
2. **Aggregates hide compensating errors — at least six times.** A +13.8% memory sum was
   three errors two of which cancelled, the largest being 25% of one term. A cc-traces
   latency within 5% was **+52% TTFT against −30% decode**. Hence per-term validation
   everywhere.
3. **Every failure mode in this design is silent.** A causality violation, a specialized
   trace, a dead gate, a contaminated reading — none of them crash. They produce a
   plausible table. Hence always-on assertions, loud aborts, and gates whose state is
   written into the artifact rather than inferred from a flag.
4. **Concentration rescues the cost model.** Sixteen operators cover a step, half the time
   in two, twelve kinds cover 99.7%. 60–75% of step time sits in 8–20 **opaque leaves**. So
   the job is pricing ~20 leaves well, not decomposing everything.
5. **The instrument has a floor.** Pricing repeats to 0.96% summed, 1.18% median per
   signature, **p90 32%**. *Any residual quoted below about 2% is quoting the instrument,
   not the model.*

## Glossary

The documents use these precisely; a reader will bounce off without them.

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **provenance** | how an answer was obtained. `analytical` (computed without measuring the subject) / `measured` (the unit itself was timed) / `fitted` (a form chosen, coefficients regressed) / `interpolated` (nearby measurements looked up) / `extrapolated` (asked outside the measured range). *"Priced" is not a species* — a price is `measured`, differing only in unit. |
| **opaque leaf** | an operator the tracer records as one node whose internal kernels are invisible, because ATOM deliberately registers a whole subsystem as a single dispatcher op. ~20 of them hold 60–75% of step time. |
| **logical process (LP)** | the unit the Clock Authority coordinates. *Not* an OS process — a TP group is one LP, a DP group is one LP, because both already have a hardware barrier. |
| **structure** | a distinct operator list, independent of shape. Prefill has two (chunked, unchunked); decode has one across all CUDA-graph rungs. Traces are cached per structure, not per shape. |
| **treatment** | a factor that moves cost and is invisible to every feature in the model. Decode **row order** is one, worth 1.77× at a fixed context multiset. |
| **tier** | which cost model was asked (0 analytic / a coarse / b op-level). Orthogonal to provenance. |
| **refusal** | a declined answer with a named reason. Refusals are results, not errors, and are preferred to fallbacks everywhere. |

## Conventions

- Every document opens with a **status header** recording its review state.
- Each file is a **design topic**; the numbered `D*` items inside it are **design points**.
  A topic owns several points. Sub-numbered points (`D3.1`, `D25.1`) extend the
  point they hang off, rather than renumbering everything downstream.
- Decisions are numbered **`D*`**, continuous across documents, with a decision log at the
  end of each. TODOs are **`T*`**, likewise continuous.
- Documents cite each other by number and decision — *"`07` D41"*.
- Claims carry their measurement. A number without a source is a defect.
- **Refuse rather than fall back.** The archetypal failure was an oracle asked about a step
  kind it had no samples of falling back to the mean of an empty list — zero — producing
  *"a confident, precise, entirely fictional answer"*: a TTFT of 0 ms against a real 7.6 s.

## Reading order

### Part I — Architecture: what a simulated run *is*

| Doc | Title | What it settles |
|---|---|---|
| [`01`](01_execution_and_time_model.md) | Execution and Time Model | Keep ATOM's multi-process topology. A central **Clock Authority** grants virtual time; logical processes collapse onto ATOM's existing hardware barriers. Which waits are rewritten, annotated, disabled or ignored. Three always-on causality detectors. KV transfer simulated; Atomesh untouched; arrivals via a next-arrival bound. |
| [`02`](02_model_runner_and_cost_backend.md) | Model Runner Seam and Cost Backend | Attach at `ModelRunner.forward`, delivered by a `--runner-qualname` subclass — **no ATOM change for the injection**. The runner has no modes; the algorithm comes from a pluggable backend. Trace is device-free and may be lazy; measure needs a device and never is. The milestone-1 fake model. |

### Part II — What is modelled

| Doc | Title | What it settles |
|---|---|---|
| [`05`](05_machine_spec_and_probes.md) | Machine Specification and its Probes | The one input artifact describing device, host, interconnect and the software stack it is pinned to. Read this before `03` and `04`, both of which consume it. Probe tools and their contamination refusals. |
| [`03`](03_memory_and_kv_model.md) | Memory Model and the KV Pool | **Do not simulate the KV pool** — ATOM's real one is pure arithmetic. Substitute the five device readings, never the arithmetic. How a prefix-cache hit reaches the cost model. Validate per term, never as a sum. |
| [`04`](04_model_capture_and_cost_ir.md) | Model Capture and the Cost IR | Capture with `TorchDispatchMode` + `FakeTensorMode` + `ShapeEnv`. A hierarchical, symbolic, stream-annotated IR whose `Repeat` nests and tolerates non-contiguous layer patterns. **Opaque leaves** are priced, not decomposed. |
| [`10`](10_analytic_laws.md) | Analytic Laws (Tier 0) | Cost and memory from device parameters and model geometry, with no measurement of the subject. Three classes: exact from geometry, device-parameterised, policy-determined. Declared accuracy goals with **ranking** as the primary gate. **The most speculative document here.** |

### Part III — How the data is made

| Doc | Title | What it settles |
|---|---|---|
| [`07`](07_calibration_toolchain.md) | Calibration and Benchmarking Toolchain | `compass plan` as the single entry point, and one recommended flow it emits. The minimal recipe: one full-engine run at TP1, plus one TP2 transfer test, plus a startup per width. Four classes of communication pricing. The artifact store, its keys and its invalidation matrix. |
| [`09`](09_fitting_and_law_selection.md) | Fitting and Law Selection | How measurements become a model: fit relative error, per-rung decode, hull guards not bounding boxes, and why leave-one-out cannot choose a family. Owns coverage geometry for every other document. |

### Part IV — How it is driven and judged

| Doc | Title | What it settles |
|---|---|---|
| [`06`](06_workload_harness_contract.md) | Workload Harness Contract | A three-part contract, not a bespoke client. agentx-harness reused with **zero edits** via an out-of-tree plugin. One namespaced additive field each direction, audited for minimality. Timeline piggybacked on `kv_transfer_params` so Atomesh needs no change. Tokenizer cost is a queue, not a constant. |
| [`08`](08_validation_protocol.md) | Validation Protocol | ATOM's own test suite as the first validation layer, in two tiers: a driver-free CPU tier over 130 of 189 files, green at **4030 passed / 0 failed** (3956 ATOM + 74 `tests/compass`; node 18 CPU container), and a GPU superset judged as a **delta** against **4779 / 5** (`fe9ea043c`, torch 2.10.0+rocm7.2.4, ROCm 7.2.4, AITER v0.1.21.dev0-49-gf4e7c7509, all five failing node-ids on file). Three separable results, never one number. **The real-vs-real spread is the tolerance.** A metric is admissible only if stable *and* sensitive. |
| [`11`](11_metrics_support.md) | Engine Metrics under Virtual Time | ATOM's Prometheus exporter under a virtual clock. Metrics are classified by the **provenance of their value**, not their type. Sample once per engine step — virtual time is discrete-event. Both metrics clock reads stay real. |

### Part V — Cross-cutting

| Doc | Title | What it settles |
|---|---|---|
| [`13`](13_configuration_surface.md) | The Configuration Surface | Three homes for a setting, and the test that assigns them. Precedence is CLI > env > artifact > **refuse**. Eight engine-side flags, one `compass` executable, and an audit of what is deliberately *not* a flag. |
| [`14`](14_speculative_decoding.md) | Speculative Decoding and MTP | Three of the four changes are routine. Acceptance is a **declared input** through ATOM's existing flags, fed the *measured per-position distribution* rather than a mean. No new cost form — decode becomes the `N_Q = 1` case of the general one. |
| [`15`](15_parallelism_support.md) | Parallelism Support | One frame of four questions per strategy. **Only PP adds logical processes** - TP, DP and EP each sit behind a barrier ATOM already has. DP is the one that couples *scheduling decisions*, through a per-forward collective that rewrites the batch; both its collectives run for real, because both reduce over scheduling metadata rather than model outputs. Explicit M1/M7 split. |

### Part VI — What is not settled

| Doc | Title | What it holds |
|---|---|---|
| [`12`](12_open_items.md) | Open Items | The five load-bearing assumptions and their check plans; the missing-topic register; T1–T72, T77–T80 and T82; cross-cutting issues; pending amendments. |

### Part VII — How it gets built

| Doc | Title | What it settles |
|---|---|---|
| [`16`](16_execution_plan.md) | The Execution Plan | Tasks are a **pool**, capped at 5 in flight, with context durable in the task's GitHub issue and PR rather than in an agent. Phase 0 de-risks five assumptions before any build work. Effort in lines of code, not dates. Detailed through Wave 3, deliberately coarse beyond. |

### Headline decisions

| # | Decision |
|---|---|
| D1 | Keep ATOM's multi-process and multi-thread topology; every change is additive |
| D3 | A central **Clock Authority**; grant rule `min_j(now[j] + L[j→i])`; logical processes collapse onto existing hardware barriers |
| D4 | Four-category wait contract: ~6 rewritten, ~10 annotated, ~20 disabled, ~20 ignored |
| D10 | Attach at `ModelRunner.forward` via `--runner-qualname`; no ATOM change for the injection |
| D13 | Do not simulate the KV pool; run ATOM's real one |
| D14 | Substitute the five device readings, never the arithmetic |
| D18 | Capture with dispatch mode + FakeTensor + ShapeEnv; `_EnablePythonDispatcher()` is mandatory |
| D19 | Hierarchical, symbolic, stream-annotated IR; no branches in the IR — applicability is a discrete key plus an evaluated guard domain |
| D20 | Opaque leaves are priced, not decomposed; each carries a declared parameter extractor |
| D28 | Additive optional fields on the **real** endpoint, both directions |
| D30 | Piggyback the simulated timeline on `kv_transfer_params`; Atomesh needs zero changes |
| D36 | Three tiers: analytic, coarse empirical, op-level empirical. Compass models a device it has been measured on |
| D37 | `compass plan` — the tool tells the user what to measure |
| D45 | The real-vs-real spread is the tolerance; a metric must be stable **and** sensitive |
| D3.2 | Three always-on causality detectors; a straggler fails the run rather than warning |
| D3.3 | The Clock Authority ships two deployment forms from one implementation: co-hosted by default, standalone for multi-container runs |
| D43.1 | ATOM's suite is a merge gate on every Compass change, unmodified, in two tiers: a driver-free CPU tier (130 of 189 files, green at 4030 passed) per change, a GPU superset judged as a delta per wave against 4779 / 5, by an equality on a per-tree expectation rather than "no worse than". The CPU tier **exits 98** rather than reporting "GPU not required" when it cannot tell |
| D67.1 | Tier 0 is graded on **configuration ranking** first; its latency goals are diagnostics for that, not the result |
