# ATOM Compass — Design Topic 17: Step Fit Backend (Tier a)

**Status:** draft under review on PR #626; not yet approved. Drafted by an AI assistant
from the design PR #626 proposed and the owner's rulings on
[#696](https://github.com/jgong5/ATOM/issues/696) (2026-10-09 and 2026-10-10). No code has
been written against it yet; implementation follows the execution plan in `16`.

**Depends on:** `02` (the backend interface, the forward's interval, the provenance
species), `07` (the tiers, the bench, artifact identity and invalidation), `08` (stage 2's
protocol and the refusal rule this topic departs from), `09` (the hull and law
validation), `13` (the flag surface), `14` (the cost form), `15` (DP and PP).

**Scope.** One tier-a cost backend, `StepFitBackend` (config id `step_fit`): a sparse grid
of measured whole-forward times, looked up for each batch, plus a residual fitted on
replayed batches that carries what the grid's coordinates cannot see. It is a candidate
backend for [#627](https://github.com/jgong5/ATOM/issues/627)'s stage 2 and gets one
non-graded evaluation on DeepSeek-V4-Pro. It does not cover tier b, the tier-a law of `09`
D54 (DP-attention's tier a, [#529](https://github.com/jgong5/ATOM/issues/529)), or KV
transfer (`01` D6).

**Three deliberate departures**, each by owner ruling on #696. Every other conflict
between #626 and the decided design is resolved in the decided design's favour, and the
decision that adopts it says which.

| Departs from | How | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| `07` D36: tier b is what acceptance cells use | a tier-a backend is graded as a stage-2 candidate | D96 |
| `07` D39: step measurements come from replayed batches | the baseline grid is synthetic and homogeneous; the residual is fitted on replayed batches | D98 |
| `08` D50.1 items 1, 3 and 4, and `13` D80's default that follows them: a refusal marks and continues | a refusal aborts the run, and a graded run is refusal-free by coverage | D102 |

## D96. Role: a tier-a candidate for stage 2

### What it is

An answer is the grid's value at the batch's coordinates (D99), corrected by a residual
fitted over the batch's own features (D100). That is tier a by `07` D36's definition —
fitted over features `ScheduledBatch` already carries, needing measured steps — and it is
a plain `CostBackend` (`02` D11): `estimate(batch_view)` returns a `StepCost`, `describe()`
one line. No Cost IR and no op-level model.

The name describes the method. A bundle is identified by its key (D101), never by a name
or an experiment round. Each answer's provenance uses `02` D11's species (D99).

### The stage-2 candidacy

Step fit is graded by stage 2's protocol: Qwen3.8-27B TP1 on MI308X, aggregated, at the
client counts of `08` D50's stage-2 row, by `08` D44's three results alone. Stage 2 runs
one configuration, so there is no ranking gate.

This does not make step fit the backend every stage-2 run, or any other work, must use.
Which backend stage 2 is passed with stays #627's ruling; the other candidate is #529's
`09` D54 law.

**A use beyond `07` D36.** D36's "used for" column gives tier a structure discovery,
sweeps and plumbing, and gives tier b the acceptance cells. Grading a tier-a backend on
stage 2 goes beyond that column, by the owner's ruling on #696; D36 carries a note.

Before grading, `09` D59's validation is a planned step (`16` S2.5): the residual is
validated on data held out from its fit, at least three candidate families are ranked and
all reported, and the chosen form is tested on a second axis. That data comes from the
development sessions, never from the sessions grading holds out (`08` D50).

Stage 2 has no MTP. MTP is M2's, on DeepSeek-V4-Pro only (`14`, *Milestone placement*);
step fit refuses a speculative step (D97).

### What it is not

- **Not a stage-3 backend.** Its one DeepSeek-V4-Pro evaluation is not graded and is
  outside M2's ranking gate (D105).
- **Not the source of the per-family MI308X tables** of `08` D50.2 item 3 and `16` W5.5.
  Those are operator-family tables for the projection method; step fit's grid holds whole
  forwards. Both take MI308X time (`16`, *The GPU booking queue*).
- **Not for Kimi-K3 or DCP in v1.** Both come after v1 (`16`, *After v1*). DCP's
  correction is described as an optional recipe, generically (D100).

---

## D97. The pricing boundary: one whole forward, one term

### One term per step

The whole batch is one `StepCost` with a single term covering the forward's interval
(D98): compute, logits, sampling, the in-forward TP collectives and their overlap. The term
is not multiplied by TP, and no collective terms are added beside it, because the
measurement already contains them. The lookup's value, the residual and each member's
output are diagnostics in the provenance detail, never terms, so no term is negative. The
term is in seconds; a bundle's unit is converted once, at that boundary.

### The runner prices, the engine charges

- **One charge per logical forward.** The predicted forward's runner prices its own
  rank's batch with the installed backend, and the cost rides on the step's output to the
  engine, whose clock owner charges it (`01` D4, K1). A real forward carries no cost and
  charges nothing. The backend never touches the clock and never sleeps.
- **The label is the group's step.** A step measurement of a TP group is the group's
  step, which `01` charges to its slowest rank (`15` D90), so a step is priced once, never
  per rank.
- **DP and PP.** Under DP the `15` D90 `max` exchange is the rule, but every bundle this
  topic plans is measured at DP 1, so a DP run mismatches the key and refuses (D101);
  DP-attention's tier a stays #529's. A PP stage refuses to price: `15` D91 prices each
  stage, and a whole-step label cannot price a stage.
- **Only executed batches are priced**, intermediate prefill chunks included: a chunk that
  samples nothing still costs forward time (`02` D10). A forward is atomic: no op-level,
  pipeline or cross-step overlap.
- **The step's output keeps `02` D10's three semantics.** The cost rides on the output,
  not beside it, so the deferred-token protocol is unchanged and nothing visible is
  published before the grant.

### Inputs

- **Rows in the batch's own order**, never sorted or merged; position features read order
  (D100).
- **Per request:** `N_Q`, the query tokens this forward computes, and the cached context,
  the tokens whose KV existed before it. A `BatchView` row carries the visible context,
  cached plus query, so cached context is `context_tokens - query_tokens`.
- **Phases.** Every row prefill: the prefill grid, single-token prefill included. Every
  row decode with `N_Q = 1`: the decode grid. A mix refuses. A decode row with `N_Q > 1`
  (speculative decoding) refuses: the decode grid has no `N_Q` axis.
- **Validated at the boundary, never coerced.** An empty batch, a non-integer or negative
  count, or an unknown phase refuses.
- **The backend imports nothing from ATOM** (`02` D11). What reads ATOM's configuration
  (D101) lives outside the backend package.

### Outside the backend

Queueing emerges from events. KV transfer has its own model (`01` D6). The estimator's
own CPU time is simulator overhead, which counts against the speed target (`08` D51) and
never against the forward. Worker dispatch and IPC are not forward time.

---

## D98. The grid: synthetic, homogeneous, planned from shapes

### The departure from `07` D39

D39 forbids synthesised batches for step measurements: row order moved decode attention
**1.77x** at one context multiset, and a fit is blind to a dimension it never varied. Step
fit departs from that **for the baseline only**. The grid is synthetic and homogeneous
because a grid gives regular, controllable coverage: the plan chooses every corner, so
whether a cell is complete (D99) is something the plan can guarantee, which replayed
batches cannot. D39's two hazards are carried by the residual, fitted on replayed batches
in the first version (D100), so row order and raggedness are covered before grading.

### Planning: from shapes, never timings

- **Sparse, and placed from shapes.** First `07` Phase 0's population on the registered
  case set, then the real runs' step tables. Never from timings: a node placed where an
  error looked large is a node chosen by the answer.
- **The feasible region's boundary is in the grid.** Its boundary nodes, the KV capacity
  and the token budget, are grid nodes. The bundle records the configuration bounds its
  grid was planned for (D101 checks them).
- **Order.** The stage-2 real side first; then top-up measurement of the cells real
  batches fall in; then grading. Planning waits for the case set's registration (`08`
  D50), which waits for T27.

### Decode: replay on the target's own ladder

Decode is measured in replay mode on the target's own capture ladder, read from ATOM's
config (`05` D24, `13` D78). For each rung `R`, at `B = R` and at `B = previous rung + 1`,
over the context nodes. `B` is interpolated only inside one rung, never across: a batch
replays its rung's graph and pays its rung's time, as `09` D54's per-rung decode fit also
holds. A decode step that replays no graph, being wider than the widest rung, is not on
this grid and refuses (D99).

**The lookup axis follows the graph mode at measurement.** The measurement this rests on
(#626 at `1139bbca`, recomputed from the reference bundle of serving_simulator `2ce181d`):
every decode row was captured under graph replay on a host whose ladder was nearly dense,
so the rung equalled the batch size almost everywhere and a table read as `cost(B)` was
`cost(rung)`. On a sparse production ladder a batch replays a wider rung than its size, so
reading by `B`, or interpolating across rungs, underestimates in one direction, more the
sparser the ladder. The axis is a property of the measurement, so the bundle declares its
graph mode and a mismatched target refuses (D101); it is never inferred at run time.

### Prefill: eager on `(B, N_Q, cached context)`

Measured eager, distinguishing whether a chunk produces output. ATOM skips logits and
sampling for a pure middle chunk (`02` D10), so a chunk that produces no output is never
priced from one that does.

### Scope and timing

The interval is `02` D10's: the whole `ModelRunner.forward()`, sampling included. It is
timed per `07` D42, with CUDA events drained by `query()` and no per-forward synchronize,
under the target workload's sampling settings. A bundle declares its scope, and a narrower
one is refused at load.

The measurement this rests on (#626 at `1139bbca`): the reference bundle measured
`run_model` plus logits under a GPU synchronize, which leaves `ModelRunner.postprocess` —
sampling, the TP broadcast, the device-to-host copy, run serially on the same stream —
covered by no term.

Measurements are unprofiled (`08` D49 item 1) and taken on the device the real side runs
on (`08` D49 item 2). MoE time reflects the routing the measurement saw; uniform routing is
`09` D61's declared treatment.

---

## D99. Lookup: complete cells, or refuse

### Coordinates

A batch maps to grid coordinates by a deterministic function of its ordered rows: an
equivalent homogeneous shape that keeps the batch's token count and its attention work,
`Σ (N_Q·c + N_Q(N_Q+1)/2)` over requests with `c` the cached context, in exact arithmetic
so a lookup reproduces bit for bit. Prefill reads `(B, N_Q, c)` of that shape and whether
the batch produces output; decode reads `(rung, B, c)`. What the equivalent shape loses,
the raggedness and the order of the rows, is the residual's job (D100).

### Decision

- **An answer is an exact hit, or an interpolation inside a cell, only when every corner
  of the enclosing cell was measured.** Otherwise the step refuses, naming the missing
  corners.
- **Nothing else answers.** No extrapolation, clamp, missing-point recovery, completion
  from another axis, calibrated model or constant fallback (`09` D58; principle 6).
- **A hole does not fail loading.** The bundle records which cells are complete; a hole
  refuses the step that needs it.
- **A pre-run coverage check** covers the grid cells and the residual's hull (D100) for
  every real step and every Phase 0 step of the registered case set. A graded run starts
  only after it passes (D102).
- **Lookups are deterministic**: one batch and one bundle give one bit-identical answer
  (`08` D50's reproducibility assertion, `01` D3.4).

### Species, per `02` D11

A step's term carries the residual's species, `fitted`. The detail records the lookup's
own: `measured` where a homogeneous batch hits a node exactly, `interpolated` otherwise. An
exact hit on a heterogeneous batch's equivalent shape is `interpolated`, not `measured` or
`analytical`: the batch itself was never timed, and nothing was computed without measuring.
Nothing is `extrapolated`, because nothing answers outside a complete cell.

### How this sits with `09` D60

D60 found interpolation between step measurements unsafe (prefill: median 12.2%, worst
32.1%, against 2.1% for a measured ladder) and makes laws piecewise over dispatch bands read
from a leaf's recorded kernel identity. A whole-step measurement records no kernel
identity, as for `09` D54's tier-a law, so step fit cannot see a band inside a cell. That is
why a lookup is never an answer alone: the residual, fitted on replayed batches that fall
inside the cells, carries what interpolation misses, and `09` D59's validation and the
held-out grading measure whether it does.

---

## D100. The residual and its recipes

### Fitted on replayed batches

- **In the first version.** Fitted through the compass toolchain (`07` D37) on replayed
  batches (`07` D39) run on the bench, as relative error over the lookup (`09` D53), and
  reported as `09` D57 requires of every fit.
- **Development and held-out by `08` D50's session split.** The residual is fitted only on
  replayed batches of the development sessions, and grading uses only the held-out
  sessions. Both are registered before evaluation, with the bundle digest (`07` D41).
- **Features in `14` D85's form**: tokens, `Σ N_Q²` and `Σ N_Q·N_KV` over requests, the
  aggregates `ScheduledBatch` carries; one form for prefill and decode, a decode step being
  its `N_Q = 1` case. Plus the row order and raggedness that `07` D39 and `09` D61 name as
  treatments. Model, dtype and width select and check the bundle (D101); they never enter
  a feature. The lookup stays split by graph mode (D98): eager and replay are two
  measurements, not two forms.
- **Hull refusal.** The residual answers only inside its fitted hull (`09` D58, `08` D49
  item 6); outside, the step refuses.

### Families and members

- **Candidates per `09` D59**: at least three families ranked on data held out from the
  fit, all reported, the winner tested on a second axis (D96).
- **Members are data.** The bundle lists members, their weights and their output
  transforms. No plugins and no expression language. A member, with its dependencies,
  loads only if the bundle selects it. Nothing trains at run time.
- **Validity, checked explicitly.** Each member's output and the combined answer must be
  finite and positive. A failure refuses the step and names the member: no renormalising
  over the remaining members, no drop to the lookup alone. A load error fails startup,
  naming the member and the artifact.
- **Caching.** Any result cache is keyed by the ordered batch, never a
  permutation-invariant hash, and a hit returns the same provenance.

### Recipes: functions fixed, values injected

A recipe is a set of feature functions and the constants frozen with them (normalisers and
units). It is fixed code: no branch on a model name or a width.

- **Identity.** A recipe is named, versioned and digested over its implementation. A bundle
  fitted under another digest refuses at load.
- **Geometry and hardware constants are injected from configuration**, never written into
  a feature. Injection does not remove the refit: a new table, grid, width or device needs
  new measurements and a new fit, not a new recipe. A recipe's version changes only when a
  feature function changes. The measurement this rests on (#626 at `1139bbca`): the
  reference recipes hard-coded the DCP chunk geometry, the attention chunk budget and three
  candidate CU counts, two of them the CU counts of two GPU generations, inside feature
  functions, so a new width or device meant a code change.
- **A normaliser is not configuration.** A recipe's normalisers are frozen with it; the
  scheduler's token budget is ATOM's. Changing one never changes the other.
- **`device.compute.compute_units`** is added to the machine spec (`05` D25) when a recipe
  needs it, not here.

### Optional recipes

A correction recipe applies when the target's configuration enables what it corrects, the
bundle includes it, and the batch is inside its domain. That is checked after the bundle
matches the target, so a mismatch refuses rather than skipping. A recipe not selected
loads nothing; an inapplicable one is recorded as skipped. DCP's correction is the first
such recipe and comes after v1; it reads DCP's state as ATOM's own DCP helper reads it.

---

## D101. Bundle identity and checks

### Identity

- **A bundle is an artifact in `07` D41's sense**, beside D41's six: a key tuple plus a
  content digest, the path only a location (D41 rule 1). The key is (model, device,
  parallel configuration, the engine configuration the grid was planned for, source-root
  digest).
- **Immutable once handed off** (D41 rule 4). A changed coefficient is a new bundle, and
  accuracy reports are not inherited.
- **#626's manifest** (digests, dependencies, a five-step load) is a proposal for `07`
  T19, not decided here.
- **No matching bundle refuses**, naming the key that missed. A bundle of another width,
  model or device is never reused.

### Invalidation, per `07` D43

The bundle's row in D43's dependency table is invalidated by every column: ROCm, AITER and
RCCL, torch, ATOM source, model, device, and engine config, because a step measurement
covers all of them. A mismatch refuses. In particular a device or architecture mismatch
refuses (`08` D49 item 2), and drift in the ATOM source refuses rather than marking the
bundle unverified.

### Two kinds of condition

- **Keyed conditions refuse on mismatch**: the key, D43's row, the graph mode, the
  ladder, block size, KV dtype, quantization, TP width, the chunk sizes a recipe reads,
  and the declared scope (D98).
- **Derived values**, such as a chunk width computed from keyed conditions, are not
  declared separately and go into the provenance.

#626 had two more grades, both dropped. An asserted grade, where a user declares a value
the bundle cannot evidence, has nothing to cover: a bundle measured by the compass
toolchain records every condition its grid ran under. A record-only grade lets a mismatch
through, which D43 refuses.

The conditions are read from the resolved ATOM config the engine runs with, after ATOM's
own normalisation and deployment rewrites and never from a first parse of the command
line, and are never restated in a Compass setting (`05` D24, `13` D78). The width checked
is the logical TP, never the count of local workers launched.

### At startup

- **Every rung of the target's ladder inside the bundle's measured range was measured**,
  or the run refuses, listing the rungs.
- **The run's configured bounds lie within the bounds the grid was planned for** (D98), or
  the run refuses.

#626 rejected a startup gate on these bounds: they are upper bounds the scheduler can
reach, not values a run will reach, so such a gate refuses runs that never leave the grid.
Here the grid is planned to those bounds, its boundary nodes included (D98), so the check
fires only on a configuration the grid was not planned for. A step inside the bounds can
still fall in a hole; the pre-run coverage check (D99) and D102 handle that.

---

## D102. Refusal aborts the run

### Decision

**`--compass-on-refusal abort` only.** With step fit selected, `abort` is the default and
`mark` refuses at startup, by name. A graded run is refusal-free by coverage, checked
before it starts (D99), and any refusal voids that run.

### The departure from `08` D50.1

D50.1 prices a refused step by the next rung that can answer, down to tier 0 (item 1);
holds a run with more than 5% of predicted seconds refused inadmissible (item 3); and
keeps `abort` out of acceptance runs (item 4). `13` D80's default `mark` follows it. Step
fit departs from all three items. No lower rung exists for Qwen3.8-27B, since no row of
`16` authors Qwen tier-0 laws (W5.2 authors DeepSeek-V4-Pro's), so marking would have
nothing to price a refused step with. And because coverage is checked before grading,
voiding a run is stricter than the 5% gate, not looser. T92 records supporting `mark`
once a tier-0 law exists for the target.

### What a refusal leaves

Contracts, not mechanism:

- **The refused batch gets no forward, no output processing and no forward time**, and
  the clock is not rolled back. ATOM's scheduler has already changed request and KV state
  for that batch, which is why there is no rollback and no skip.
- **The run ends as failed**, not with a fabricated final grant. A failure end is
  distinct from a normal end, and every participant (engines, workers, the clock) stops
  waiting.
- **The first refusal's reason, its batch and the bundle key are kept**, the run record
  is flushed before the run ends (D104), and `01` D3.5's run summary is written and names
  the refusal.

---

## D103. Selecting the backend

- **Configured through `13` D80's flags and the artifact store**, with no Compass config
  file (`13` D79). The bundle comes from the store `--compass-artifacts` names, found by
  its key (D101).
- **One extension: `--compass-backend step_fit`.** It requires `--compass-tier a` and
  refuses with any other tier; absent, the tier answers as `13` D80 has it. It passes
  D78's test, being meaningless in a real run, so it is a Compass flag. With it,
  `--compass-on-refusal` defaults to `abort` (D102).

---

## D104. The run record, and the CPU segments

### The run record is inside `01` D3.5's outputs

- **#626's per-step run record stays, with no `off` level.** Its summary level is D3.5's
  run summary, always written. Its full level is the per-step detail of D3.5's timeline
  log, which is off by default (D3.5 rule 1).
- **Written incrementally**, and flushed before the run ends on a refusal (D102).
- **Per step:** the phase, the bundle key and digest, the recipe, the lookup's species and
  the cell it used, the residual, the optional recipes applied or skipped, and the final
  seconds.
- **From each `estimate()` return**, never from differences of cumulative counters: a
  cache hit skips lookups, so a counter difference miscounts.
- **`describe()`** is one line naming the bundle key, the recipe and the members.

### The scheduler's CPU segments

ATOM's `scheduler.schedule()` and `scheduler.postprocess()` run unchanged, and nothing
prices scheduling decisions (README, *Scope*). "Scheduler postprocess" here means
`scheduler.postprocess()`, not `ModelRunner.postprocess()`, which is inside the forward's
interval (D98).

- **No `measured` mode.** Charging the simulating host's wall clock would make two runs
  of one input disagree (`01` D3.4), and it charges time the simulated machine never spent.
- **Default `off`**: neither segment is charged, as `01` D4 has it today.
- **`fitted`** prices each segment from parameters in the machine spec's `host.*` (`05`
  D25), a host property like the tokenizer terms. It is not usable until it is measured in
  ATOM whether a segment's time adds serially to the forward or overlaps it (T93): `10`
  D64 found the host floor to be a `max`, not an addend, and a serial charge is the addend.
  When `fitted` becomes usable, `01` D4's site table is amended to name the two segments.

---

## D105. One evaluation on DeepSeek-V4-Pro, not graded

After stage 2, step fit gets one evaluation on DeepSeek-V4-Pro (`16` W4.13):

- **The cell.** The nightly TP cell — TP8, no DP-attention, no MTP, expert parallelism off
  — on MI355X, on the prefill node and the decode node.
- **The grid and fit** are planned from that cell's workload, as D98 plans stage 2's.
- **The comparison.** W4.3's per-step tables (each forward's batch and unprofiled
  seconds, `08` D49 item 1), and tier b where it is available, reported per `08` D47:
  on totals, with the largest contributor held out, and as the median per step.
- **Not a stage-3 backend**, and outside M2's ranking gate (`08` D50). No DP-attention,
  MTP, TBO or EP8 rows; #529 keeps DP-attention's tier a.

---

## Open issues

- **A dispatch band inside a cell is invisible to step fit** (D99). The residual's
  held-out error is the only detector, so a band that the replayed batches never straddle
  is not caught before grading.
- **Supporting `mark`** needs a lower rung for the target. Recorded as **T92**.
- **Whether the scheduler's CPU segments add serially to the forward or overlap it** is
  unmeasured in ATOM, and gates the `fitted` mode. Recorded as **T93**.

## Decision log

| # | Decision | Date |
|---|---|---|
| D96 | Step fit (`StepFitBackend`, `step_fit`) is a tier-a `CostBackend`: grid lookup plus a residual. A candidate for #627's stage 2, graded by stage 2's protocol after `09` D59's validation, a use beyond `07` D36 by ruling; which backend passes stage 2 stays #627's ruling. Not a stage-3 backend, not the source of the per-family MI308X tables; Kimi-K3 and DCP after v1. | 2026-10-10 (#696) |
| D97 | One term per step over the forward's whole interval, priced once per logical forward by the runner and charged by the engine. Rows in order; mixed phases and speculative decode refuse; a DP run refuses by key and a PP stage refuses. The backend imports nothing from ATOM. | 2026-10-10 (#696) |
| D98 | A synthetic homogeneous grid, departing from `07` D39 for the baseline only; sparse and planned from shapes, its boundary nodes at the feasible region's edge. Decode in replay on the target's own ladder, per rung at `B = R` and `B = previous rung + 1`; prefill eager on `(B, N_Q, c)` by whether a chunk produces output. `02` D10's interval, `07` D42's timing; a narrower declared scope refuses. | 2026-10-10 (#696) |
| D99 | An answer only from a complete cell, by exact hit or interpolation; otherwise refuse, naming the missing corners. No extrapolation, clamp, recovery or fallback. A pre-run coverage check over cells and the residual hull; deterministic lookups; `02` D11 species. | 2026-10-10 (#696) |
| D100 | The residual is in the first version, fitted on replayed batches of the development sessions in `14` D85's form plus order and raggedness, held out by `08` D50's session split, refusing outside its hull. Members are bundle data; each output checked. Recipes are fixed functions with injected geometry and hardware constants, versioned only when a function changes; optional recipes, DCP's first. | 2026-10-10 (#696) |
| D101 | A bundle is a `07` D41 key plus a digest, immutable, with a row in `07` D43 invalidated by every column. Keyed conditions refuse; derived values go to provenance; #626's asserted and record-only grades are dropped. Conditions come from the resolved ATOM config. At startup, unmeasured rungs and bounds beyond the planned grid refuse. | 2026-10-10 (#696) |
| D102 | Refusal aborts: `abort` only and by default under step fit, departing from `08` D50.1 items 1, 3 and 4. A graded run is refusal-free by coverage; any refusal voids it. The refused batch gets no forward and no time, the run ends as failed, and the first reason is kept. | 2026-10-10 (#696) |
| D103 | Selected by one new Compass flag, `--compass-backend step_fit`, with `--compass-tier a`; otherwise `13` D80's flags and the artifact store, no config file. | 2026-10-10 (#696) |
| D104 | The run record lives inside `01` D3.5's outputs with no `off` level, written incrementally and flushed on refusal, per step from each `estimate()` return. The scheduler's CPU segments: no `measured` mode, default `off`, `fitted` from `host.*` once T93 is settled. | 2026-10-10 (#696) |
| D105 | One non-graded evaluation on DeepSeek-V4-Pro's nightly TP cell on MI355X, against W4.3's step tables and tier b, reported per `08` D47; not a stage-3 backend. | 2026-10-10 (#696) |

## TODO register

This topic's items only. The consolidated register across all topics, with the
load-bearing assumptions and their check plans, is [`12_open_items.md`](12_open_items.md).

| # | Item | Why deferred |
|---|---|---|
| T92 | Support `--compass-on-refusal mark` under step fit once a tier-0 law exists for the target | no row of `16` authors a Qwen tier-0 law |
| T93 | Measure in ATOM whether the scheduler's CPU segments add serially to the forward or overlap it, before `fitted` is usable | needs a real run with per-segment timing |
