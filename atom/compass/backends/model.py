"""The stand-in model itself: one declaration, the geometry and the price.

The two halves a simulated run needs already exist in this package and are
built separately. `KvGeometry.from_hf_config` says what a KV block costs at a
set of parallel widths; `ShapeStubBackend` says what a step costs, and is told
the widths a second time so it knows which collectives to charge. Nothing
joined them, and the join is not bookkeeping:

    geometry = KvGeometry.from_hf_config(config, block_size=64,
                                         parallelism=Parallelism(tp_size=4))
    backend = ShapeStubBackend(geometry=geometry)

is accepted today. The pool is sized for four ranks and the price is a single
rank's, with no all-reduce charged at all, and nothing anywhere can notice: a
`KvGeometry` is five integers and does not record the widths it was divided
by. `FakeModel` takes the widths once and hands the same `Parallelism` object
to both, so the pair cannot be built disagreeing.

**A stand-in, not a model.** It reads no checkpoint, holds no weights and
allocates nothing. What it is for is that everything downstream of it is then
real -- ATOM's own pool sizing, block manager and scheduler run against a
genuine number per width rather than one this package decided -- and what it
says about a duration comes from declared coefficients and is not a prediction
of anything. Both halves say so themselves; `describe()` repeats it in the one
line a run record keeps.

Two config sources, because the milestone needs both:

- **A published config**, read as JSON through `hf_config`. The geometry is
  read off the real layer, head and dtype numbers, so a later backend is a
  swap rather than a rebuild. The reader is twenty lines of attribute access
  rather than a modelling library, which keeps this package importable on a
  machine that has neither the engine nor an accelerator.
- **`SyntheticStack`**, dialled rather than published, for shapes no released
  model has: a hundred-layer stack on one KV head, a head dimension nothing
  ships, a hybrid whose interval is whatever a test needs. It exposes the
  attribute names a config uses and is read by the same code path, so it
  exercises the reader rather than bypassing it.

Two layer counts, and each half reads its own. `geometry.layers` counts the
layers holding a cache of every past token, which is what a KV block is sized
from; `stage_layers` counts the layers this worker runs, which is what a
collective is charged on, since an all-reduce runs on a layer keeping a bounded
recurrent state exactly as it does on a paged one. On a stack that is one
full-attention layer in four the two differ by four and on a uniform stack they
coincide, so neither is recoverable from the other and both are handed on: the
geometry to the pool, the span to the price. Both stay readable here rather
than one being implied by the other.

Nothing constrains where the config came from, either. The `config` argument
is unannotated and read by attribute name, so a config type defined beside the
engine -- importing the engine, and buildable only on a machine that has one
-- reaches this constructor and is accepted. Neither guard on this package can
see that: the import scan reads the imports in these files and there are none
to read, and the test that checks where the types crossing this boundary are
defined reads definition sites of types this package names, not the type of
whatever an argument was handed. Closing it needs an instrument that reads
what is passed rather than what is imported. There is none here, and the route
is open.
