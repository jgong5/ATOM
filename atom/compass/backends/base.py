"""The interface a cost backend implements.

Two methods. `estimate` prices one step; `describe` says what this backend is,
in a line that goes into the run record so a result can be read a month later.

`batch_view` is a projection of the scheduled batch, prepared by the caller --
plain numbers and sequences, no engine objects. That is the whole reason this
package imports nothing from the rest of ATOM: a backend is then testable on a
machine with no accelerator and no engine, and the fields it depends on are
visible in the projection rather than reachable by attribute from anywhere in
the scheduler. The projection's shape belongs to the caller that builds it, so
it is not named here.

Whoever defines that shape inherits an obligation with it, because the
no-engine-imports property belongs to a package and not to a type. The test
that enforces it reads the files under this package and nothing else: a
projection defined here is covered automatically, and one defined anywhere
else is covered by nobody until its own package's tests assert the same thing
over its own sources. A projection that reaches an engine type for one field
is a projection that can only be built where the engine imports, which defeats
the reason it exists.

`tier` says which cost model was asked, which is a different axis from where
each answer inside it came from. A run can ask for the op-level model and still
receive analytically-computed seconds for a term the campaign never covered;
the tier records the intent and the provenance records what happened.
