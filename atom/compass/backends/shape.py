"""A stand-in cost model: declared coefficients multiplied into a step's shapes.

**What this produces is not an estimate of anything.** The coefficients were
chosen, not measured and not regressed, and multiplying one by a real shape
does not make the product a prediction of a real duration. Nothing from this
backend may be quoted as accuracy. That sentence is not left in this file for
a reader who happens to open it: the provenance on every term carries it and
`describe()` repeats it, so whoever reads the record an artifact writes is
told without reading any source.

What it is for is the loop. A fixed pair of constants prices every step the
same, so nothing the scheduler does can depend on the price and no run can
show whether it did. That was measured rather than argued: an offline workload
presents one shape per kind, so an answer per kind looked exact -- and the same
answer cost +47.9% time-to-first-token the moment shapes varied under real
serving, three prefill steps of 16, 256 and 16128 tokens costing 38.6, 151.0
and 177.6 ms and all three answered as about 47 ms. A form that reads the
shapes makes a longer chunk cost longer, a longer step is when the next
request arrives, and the next batch is a different batch. That loop is the
thing this exists to make testable; accuracy is somebody else's milestone.

The form, declared rather than derived:

    prefill:  a  + b .tokens   + c .Sum N_Q^2 + d .Sum N_Q.(N_KV - N_Q)
    decode:   a' + b'.requests + c'.Sum N_KV  + e'.(rung.max N_KV - Sum N_KV)

plus one term per collective the deployment's widths make possible. A step
carrying both kinds of work is priced as both and pays both intercepts, because
a step that did both launched both.

A tensor-parallel all-reduce runs once per layer this worker holds, so its
count is the depth of the worker's span and not the number of layers in it that
hold a cache of every past token. The two are the same number only on a stack
whose layers are all paged, and they diverge with the architecture rather than
by a factor somebody could fold into the coefficient: a layer keeping a bounded
recurrent state costs a KV block nothing and still takes part in the
all-reduce, so a stack that is one paged layer in four charges four times what
the paged count would. That depth is handed in -- the KV geometry cannot supply
it, since what it counts is the paged subset -- and a deployment with a
collective to price and no depth stated is refused rather than charged on the
count that happens to be at hand.

**That argument is the all-reduce's and it does not reach the other collective
this charges.** An expert all-to-all runs on the layers that hold experts,
which is a third count: not the paged subset, not the depth of the span, and
not something anything here can supply, since no expert arrangement is read
anywhere in this package. It is charged on the stack depth regardless, because
that is the count in hand -- so on a stack whose experts sit on a period, or
one mixing dense layers among expert ones, it is wrong in exactly the way the
paged count was wrong for the all-reduce. Two consequences are stated rather
than left to be noticed. The term for any collective other than the all-reduce
says, where its charge is read, that the depth stands in for this collective's
own count, which nothing here argues it equals; and moving the all-reduce onto
the stack depth moved the all-to-all by the same four times on the hybrid
here, which is a side effect of sharing the count in hand and not a result
about experts. Settling it needs an expert geometry and a term that reads one,
which belongs to a backend that means its numbers rather than to this one.

Two things the form does not know, stated because a reader of a number will
otherwise assume it does. It has one quadratic coefficient for the whole batch
and no notion of a layer kind, so a stack whose layers do not all grow with
history -- a recurrent or windowed layer among full-attention ones -- is priced
as if they all did; whoever sets the coefficient owns that, and a form that
needs to tell them apart needs a term per kind rather than a different number.
And the collective list it charges from is necessary rather than sufficient: an
absence is an absence, a presence is a candidate the widths admit and two
conditions outside them can still rule out. Every collective term says so in
its own provenance, so a charge that may not correspond to a collective cannot
be read back as one that did.

**Every sum runs over requests, one at a time.** `BatchView` holds one row per
request and every shape sum is a function of those rows: no constructor takes
a sum in place of the rows, and no supplied sum can disagree with the rows it
was computed from. That is the point rather than fastidiousness: collapsing a
batch to `tokens x history` and multiplying makes the quadratic term and the
cross term fixed multiples of each other over every batch a scheduler can
build. A fit cannot then separate them, and a feature computed wrongly is
indistinguishable from one that is merely unconstrained. Summing per request
was the repair.

State the property precisely, because a stronger claim was made here and it
was measured false. The type does not make the collapsed form unreachable.
A one-row `BatchView` *is* `tokens x history` -- `RequestShape(512, 2048)`
alone sums to 1048576 where the two 256-token rows it collapses sum to
524288 -- and nothing in the type ties the row count to the number of
requests a scheduler scheduled. Shadowing a reader is refused outright (see
`_refuse_shadowing`); a subclass that adds a field and redefines nothing is
accepted, and its sums still come from its rows. That closes the two routes
that fabricate a reading from a field a subclass added. The row count it does
not close and cannot: what closes that is the projection -- one row per
scheduled request, built by whoever holds the scheduled batch -- and that
builder does not live in this package yet.

`capture_rung` is a batch-level scalar, correctly so, because a rung is a
property of the replayed graph rather than of any row. Two disagreements with
the rows are refused: a rung with no decode rows names a graph that replayed
nothing, and a rung narrower than the decode row count makes the padding
negative. Both are contradictions the rows settle by themselves. A rung far
wider than the rows is not -- rows cannot contradict a width, only a ladder of
captured widths can, and this backend has no ladder -- so such a rung is
priced and labelled rather than refused: `capture_rung=10**9` on one decode
row prices `decode.graph_padding` at 99.9999999 s, and that term's provenance
says the width was supplied and nothing here bounds it. A test prices that
batch, so a successor who bounds the rung fails a test rather than leaving
this paragraph stale.

The decode padding feature is the *rung's* rectangle, `rung.max - Sum`, and
not the batch's `len.max - Sum`. A replayed graph runs its rung's worth of
rows whatever the batch brought, so the batch's rectangle understates the
padding by exactly the ratio between the two -- which reads as a small
correction at a full rung and a large one at an empty one, and survives
evidence-widening because it is wrong in proportion to something nobody is
plotting. A rung on a step with no decode work is refused outright: that is
the same error in its other direction, a graph charged for a prefill that
replayed nothing.

    Pricing one needs a layer count, and there are two of them. `stack_layers`
    is the one the charge is made on: every layer this worker runs, whatever
    each layer keeps. `geometry` is the KV a block is sized from, whose own
