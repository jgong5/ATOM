"""The cost of one step, and the parts it was built from.

A `StepCost` does not store a total. `seconds` is folded from `terms` on every
read, and the breakdown is re-checked on every read rather than only at
construction, so the whole cannot come to disagree with its parts by any route
that leaves the object itself in place. Subclassing is refused where it would
shadow the total, the terms or the rows, because a subclass needs no bypass at
all to return one number while its breakdown says another.

An empty breakdown is refused outright. The failure behind that is the mean of
an empty sample, which is not an error, is not approximately zero, and is
exactly 0.0 -- a precise and entirely fictional answer that reads as a fast
step rather than as a missing model. The same shape is refused one layer up:
`ProvenanceMix` will not divide by an empty run, because "nothing refused" and
"nothing recorded" would otherwise be the same number, and it is the
reassuring one.

Every addition of seconds in this module goes through `fold_seconds`: a left
fold from 0.0 over values in the order given, with `fold_step` as its one-step
form for running totals. The only `+` outside them counts whole steps and
reasons, which are integers. Float addition is not associative, so two readers
who sum the same terms in different orders get different bits, and a run that
has to be reproducible cannot leave that to whoever writes the next summing
loop. Routing every sum through one function is what makes the order a
property of the module rather than a coincidence that holds until someone
adds a `+`.
