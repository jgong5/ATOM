"""Tier a: one rank's step priced by a fitted linear law.

A step is prefill or decode, never both. Prefill has one coefficient vector,
decode one per capture rung, each over the features `ShapeStubBackend` reads:

    prefill:        [1, tokens, Sum N_Q^2, Sum N_Q.(N_KV - N_Q)]
    decode, rung r: [1, Sum N_KV, r.max N_KV - Sum N_KV]

A decode step that replays no graph (an eager runner, or a batch wider than
the widest captured size) is the rung named `eager`, whose padding is zero.

Each vector carries the convex hull of the features it was fitted on. A step
outside it is priced by the same vector and its terms are `extrapolated`, with
a detail naming the hull; it is not refused. A step the law has no vector for
is refused: a decode rung with none, or a step mixing prefill and decode rows.

The law is a mapping, as a run file holds it:

    {"provenance": "<what it was fitted on>",
     "prefill": VECTOR,
     "decode": {"eager": VECTOR, "1": VECTOR, "2": VECTOR, ...}}

    VECTOR = {"coefficients": {<feature>: seconds, ...},
              "hull": {"equal": {<feature>: value, ...}, "facets": [[a_1, ..., a_k, c], ...]}}

`coefficients` names every feature of its kind, `step` for the intercept.
`equal` holds each feature that was constant over the fit and the value a step
must have; `facets` bound the remaining non-intercept features, in the order
above, as `a . x + c <= 0` inside: the rows of qhull's `ConvexHull.equations`.
