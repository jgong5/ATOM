"""The KV shape a stand-in model presents, and how parallelism divides it.

This is a test double. From the engine's side it is indistinguishable from a
model in the one respect the engine needs before it can start -- it says how
many bytes a KV block costs -- and it is not an accurate account of any real
one. It omits the fp32 scale plane the aiter backends carry, and it sizes no
per-request recurrent state. What it buys is that everything downstream is
then real: ATOM's own `page_pool`, `plan_pools` and `BlockManager` do the
sizing, and they get a genuinely different answer per parallel width rather
than a number this module decided.

Nothing here imports the engine, so the arithmetic runs anywhere Python does.
The two places the engine owns the answer are handed in rather than guessed:
which layers a pipeline stage holds comes from ATOM's own partitioner as a
`layer_range`, and the byte budget is the caller's.

What each axis does to the KV, and the one that surprises people:

- **TP** cuts the KV heads, bounded by grouped-query attention. Below one head
  per rank the heads are replicated instead of cut, so a rank's KV stops
  shrinking -- a model with four KV heads holds the same KV at eight ranks as
  at four. The bound is read off the config's KV head count, never inferred
  from the query heads.
- **PP** gives a stage its own layers, so its KV is that slice and its block
  is that much cheaper. It is also what makes more than one participant for
  the clock to coordinate.
- **DP** replicates: each engine holds a full KV, so the per-engine block is
  unchanged and there are `dp_size` of them.
- **EP** shards experts and leaves the KV alone -- structurally so here, since
  the expert width is not an input to the geometry at all.

The collective that rides on that last point is measured, not deduced. With
one data-parallel rank ATOM builds no all-to-all at all, even with expert
parallelism on: the MoE is local compute masked per rank plus the
tensor-parallel all-reduce. So `collectives()` names one on the data-parallel
width and never on the expert width, which is the way round that gets that
case wrong.

`collectives()` is a **necessary** condition, not a sufficient one, and the
gap is named here because nothing downstream can see it. ATOM builds its
peer-to-peer MoE path only when two further things hold that these widths
cannot express: the deployment is not being simulated wider than the box, and
the peer-to-peer library is installed. There is also one case in the other
direction -- the mega MoE backend installs its experts unconditionally and
does run peer-to-peer at a single data-parallel rank. So a reader may take a
collective missing from this list as absent, and must not take one present in
it as built.
