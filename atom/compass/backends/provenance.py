"""How a cost was obtained, and what a declined answer carries.

Every number a cost backend produces says where it came from. The vocabulary
is closed and small, and an unlabelled cost cannot be built: `Provenance`
takes a `Species` with no default, and `CostTerm` takes a `Provenance` with no
default, so there is no constructor path that produces a number whose origin
is unknown.

The five species answer "how was this answer obtained", which is a different
question from "which cost model was asked". A step-level timing read back out
of a file is still `MEASURED`; what a lookup changes is whether the key matched
exactly (`MEASURED`), matched the nearest neighbour (`INTERPOLATED`) or sat
outside the range that was measured at all (`EXTRAPOLATED`). "Priced" is not a
species either -- a price is a measurement of a smaller unit, and the unit goes
in `detail`, as `measured (op-level)` against `measured (step-level)`.

`ANALYTICAL` is the one word that is reserved rather than aspirational: it
means the subject was computed without ever being measured, and a backend that
fits coefficients to timings is `FITTED`, not analytical, however tidy the
closed form looks.

A `Refusal` is a declined answer with a named reason, and it is a value rather
than an error. Every refusal collected while resolving a cost is carried on the
provenance of the cost that was produced instead -- all of them, earliest
first, not just the one that renders -- so a cost that came from further down a
ladder cannot be mistaken for one that came from the top of it, and a count of
reasons is not quietly missing the middle of the chain.
