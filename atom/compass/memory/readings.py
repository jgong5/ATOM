"""The five readings `get_num_blocks` takes off a card, taken off a spec instead.

The rule is **substitute the readings, never the arithmetic**. ATOM's
`get_num_blocks` (`model_runner.py:1686-1900`) is five device readings and then
some arithmetic over them; this module owns the five, and the budget formula,
the 2% margin, the `min(budget, free)` clamp and `plan_pools` stay ATOM's. A
copy of that formula here is exactly the drift the substitution exists to avoid,
and upstream will change it.

| Reading | Where it comes from now |
|---|---|
| `total` | `device.memory.capacity_bytes` |
| `peak_torch` | weights + buffers + load residue + persistent + activations |
| `non_torch` | `driver_and_collective_reserve_bytes`, a width table |
| `cudagraph_overhead` | `graph_pool.reserves()` -- the number that reserves |
| `free` | derived as a clean box: `total - peak_torch - non_torch` |

**`free` is derived and that is load-bearing, twice over.** ATOM reads it as
`(total - free) - reserved`, and `total - free` counts every process on the
card: six prior runs died at start-up with `non_torch=152.01GB` because a
neighbour held 152 GB while this rank had reserved 2.9 GB. Taking `non_torch`
from a spec removes that contamination by construction. And with `free` derived
as the box that is left, the `min(budget, free)` clamp cannot bind -- the prior
design needed a `free_was_binding()` guard to refuse records where it had, and
this one does not. Making it inert is this module's job; ATOM's own budget
arithmetic runs over these readings in `atom.compass.runner.overrides`, and
`test_the_min_budget_free_clamp_does_not_bind_on_either_side_of_free` in
`tests/compass/test_kv_budget_engine.py` checks that the clamp does not bind.

The declared scope boundary that follows, stated so it is not discovered as a
gap: Compass models a **dedicated** device. It will not predict the OOM a shared
box produces and will not reproduce a neighbour-induced admission cliff.

**Two of the five `peak_torch` terms are not obtainable here.** Weights are
exact from a meta build deduped by storage -- at every width on both models
tested -- and buffers need a recording, because the formula that matched the
0.6B was 4x wrong on the 27B. A meta build needs a module
tree, which needs the engine, which this tier does not import; and there is no
recording of a card nobody has run. So `ModelTerms` takes those two terms rather
than deriving them, with no default -- the same shape as the spec's "a runtime
constant has no default" rule, and for the same reason. `from_declared_config`
fills all three with declared formulas and labels every one of them. For the
activation term a declared formula is the only answer while no op graph
exists; this module gives the other two the same treatment, visibly.
