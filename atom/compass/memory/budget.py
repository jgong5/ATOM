"""A block count, carrying the readings ATOM's budget arithmetic sized it from.

`get_num_blocks` answers one integer, and by the time the scheduler reads it
the five readings and their eleven terms are gone. An integer that came out of
a coefficient somebody wrote down looks exactly like one that came off a card,
and on this tree most of what enters the budget is the first kind: the model
side of `peak_torch` and the graph-pool reservation are both declared formulas
with no measurement of this card behind them. `SizedKVPool` is the count kept
beside its inputs, so the decomposition survives the arithmetic instead of
being recoverable only from a log line nobody kept.

**No arithmetic ATOM owns is repeated here.** The budget formula, the 2%
margin, the `min(budget, free)` clamp and `plan_pools` produced the count; this
module receives it. What it computes is over the readings only -- which of them
were subtracted, and how many of those bytes are declared -- and none of that
enters the count.
