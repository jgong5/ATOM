"""A simulated run's non-KV memory against a real run's, one term at a time.

    python -m atom.compass.memory.check PREDICTED SERVER_LOG

PREDICTED is a ``memory-<engine>.json`` that a simulated run writes into its
``out_dir``: the readings its KV pool was sized from, the warmup shape, and
what the graph pool really costs. SERVER_LOG is the log of one real ATOM
server with the same deployment.

A real server logs each reading once, in its ``Memory budget`` line, so the
terms compared are ``peak_torch`` and ``non_torch``. Each predicted reading
enters as one term and its own terms are printed under the table; one that
sums a term which cannot discharge the gate cannot discharge it either. The
graph pool is compared apart, both of its numbers against the pool the
real server's capture reserved.
