"""A memory reading and the terms it was composed of, which it cannot shed.

The rule this file carries is about arithmetic that has already gone wrong
once: a summed non-KV memory check read +13.8% while holding three errors,
two of which cancelled, and the largest of them was 25% of its own term. The
conclusion drawn is that every term is validated individually, never as a sum.
A reading object that can be printed only as a total reproduces that failure by
design, so this one cannot be:

- `Reading` holds its terms and derives the total on every read, so the two
  cannot drift apart and there is no constructor that takes a total.
- It defines no `__int__` and no `__index__`. A reading cannot be spent as a
  number by accident; a caller that wants the number asks for `.total` and the
  call site says so.
- `__str__` is the per-term table. Printing a reading prints its decomposition,
  which is the rule against reporting an aggregate without its decomposition,
  made structural rather than remembered.

**`Basis` is not `Species`.** `backends/provenance.py` answers *how a cost was
obtained* -- analytical, measured, fitted, interpolated, extrapolated. This enum
answers a different question about a different subject: *where this memory
term's bytes came from* -- a named field of the machine spec, a knob ATOM's
own config states, arithmetic over other readings, or a coefficient somebody
wrote down. There is deliberately no `GEOMETRY` member: a serving knob is a
property of the deployment rather than of the machine or the model, and
nothing on the model side is *obtained* yet -- every term
read off a model config here is a declared formula, and labelling one
`GEOMETRY` would say it was not.

`OBTAINED` is the one that was missing, and it is the word the paragraph above
already uses for what a declared term is not: **the number was read off the
thing it describes** -- a meta build of the model, a recording of a card, a
traced graph. That is the whole of the definition, and it is deliberately not
"a recording": a term on either side of a comparison can carry it, and the
predicted side does whenever a meta build or a liveness walk produced the
number. It is the successor every `DECLARED` term names, so a term that carries
it is a term that no longer owes one. Nothing this package produces carries it
*today* -- every model-side term it computes is a declared formula -- which is
a statement about what has been built, not about who may use the member.

`OBTAINED` is also not `Species.MEASURED` under another name, for the same
reason the paragraph above separates the two enums at all. `Species` answers
*how a cost answer was obtained* and its members are the ways a cost model can
have been fitted; `MEASURED` there means a timing came from a benchmark rather
than from a law. `OBTAINED` here answers *where a memory term's bytes came
from*, and a meta build is neither a benchmark nor a law -- it is arithmetic
over the model's own tensors. The two words sit on different subjects and one
would be the wrong answer on the other's.

The two vocabularies are kept apart deliberately. A declared coefficient has no
word in `Species` and adding one is an open owner ruling, so nothing
here touches that enum; `Basis.DECLARED` carries the distinction on this side of
the boundary, and it is the one place a ruling would land.

A declared term must say what replaces it. That is the whole difference between
a declared number and a guess: `Term` refuses to hold `DECLARED` without a note,
so the record of what is still owed is written where the number is, not in a
document beside it.
