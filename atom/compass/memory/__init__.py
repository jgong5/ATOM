"""The memory model: the five device readings, produced without a device.

`ModelRunner.get_num_blocks` is five readings off a card and then arithmetic
over them. This package owns the five, so that an MI308X host can size the KV
pool of a card it does not have, and it deliberately owns none of the
arithmetic -- the budget formula, the 2% margin, the `min(budget, free)` clamp
and `plan_pools` are ATOM's and stay ATOM's.

Three properties are enforced here rather than described.

**A reading is its terms.** `Reading` derives its total on every read, defines
no `__int__`, and prints as a per-term table. The reason is an incident: a
summed non-KV check once read +13.8% while holding a 25% error in one of its
terms, and an object printable only as a total reproduces that by design.

**`free` is a clean box.** `total - peak_torch - non_torch`, never a reading, so
the neighbour contamination in `(total - free) - reserved` cannot enter and the
`min(budget, free)` clamp cannot bind.

**Nothing here imports a tensor library, a device runtime or the engine.** The
absence of a device read is therefore a property of the import graph rather than
a claim about the code paths, and it is checked as one.

The two graph-pool numbers are kept apart in `graph_pool`, by name and at the
call site, because they disagree by 4-19x and only one of them reserves.

**A prediction is held to its gate one term at a time.** `compare` takes a
breakdown a hardware run printed -- as input data; nothing here runs a model --
and returns a per-term table with no total in it. The aggregate exists only as
a `SummedCheck`, which cannot be built without the comparison it summarises,
because the instrument that reads one figure over a decomposition is the one
`03` D16 was written to reject.
