"""A predicted non-KV footprint held to its gate one term at a time.

The rule this module implements is **validate per term, never as a sum**, and
the incident behind it is why it has no call that returns a total. A summed
non-KV check once read **+13.8%** while holding three errors, two of which
cancelled: weights over by **+0.280 GB** (a tied `lm_head` that is never
resident), activations compared at the wrong shape (**-0.015 GB**), and
**-0.084 GB** of a resident term nobody had noticed existed. The largest of the
three was **25% of its own term**, and the sum said 13.8%.

So this module compares term by term, and the aggregate is available only as a
`SummedCheck`, which cannot be constructed without the comparison it summarises
and renders the per-term table underneath itself. That is the rule against
reporting an aggregate without its decomposition, made structural rather than
remembered, the same way `terms.Reading` makes it structural for a reading.

**It costs no GPU time.** Every hardware run already prints its own breakdown;
a `Recorded` is that printout, handed in as input data. Nothing here runs a
model, imports the engine or touches a device, and a comparator that needed one
would be a comparator nobody could run against the card they are sizing for.

## What a term can come back as

| outcome | when |
|---|---|
| `Verdict.PASS` | both sides present, within the gate, and the predicted side carries a basis that can discharge one -- see below |
| `Verdict.FAIL` | both sides present and outside the gate -- **including** when the predicted side is a declared coefficient, because a recording that contradicts a coefficient is evidence |
| `Verdict.NOT_DISCHARGED` | both sides present and within the gate, but the predicted side carries a basis that cannot discharge one. The error is reported and the gate is not called discharged |
| a `TermRefusal` | the two sides cannot be compared at all: the run records no such term, the run records it as zero bytes, the shapes disagree, or the recorded peak is the warmup prefill's |

**Which bases discharge a gate.** It is a stated list, not the single word
"obtained", because the bases divide three ways and only one of the three is
about a number having been read off the thing it describes.

- `Basis.SPEC` **discharges.** A machine specification's runtime constants are
  filled by probe runs on a card, so a spec number is a measurement taken
  elsewhere rather than a coefficient somebody wrote down, and holding it
  against this run is a real check. What a pass does *not* say is that a law
  was validated: two of the constants this package reads -- the driver and
  collective reserve, and the load residue -- are width tables exactly because
  no closed form fits them, so a pass means the table's entry for this width
  agrees with this run and means nothing at any other width.
- `Basis.DERIVED` **discharges**, being arithmetic over readings that are
  themselves one of these.
- `Basis.OBTAINED` **discharges**: the number was read off the thing itself.
- `Basis.DECLARED` **does not.** It is a coefficient with a named successor,
  and agreement with one run does not turn a coefficient into a measurement.
- `Basis.DEPLOYMENT` **does not.** It is a knob the serving config states, and
  a knob agreeing with a run is not evidence about bytes in either direction.
  No footprint term carries it today; the only one in this package labels the
  eager-mode branch of the graph-pool estimator, which is not a footprint term.

The asymmetry between the second and third rows is deliberate: a declared term
can **fail** its gate but cannot **pass** it. The memory model is written that
way for two of the three terms it owes -- weights are exact from a meta build,
and buffers are recorded rather than computed -- and for the third it is stated
outright, that a traced graph without the invisible-scratch table does not
discharge the 10% gate on the activation term.

## The traps this module refuses rather than papers over

- **Shape.** Both sides state the shape they were taken at and a term taken at
  a shape refuses against a side taken at another. The -0.015 GB above is an
  activation term compared at the wrong shape, and a comparison that does not
  say what shape it is at cannot notice.
- **The allocator's high-water mark.** A tracing run must reset it around the
  step it writes a graph for, or the peak belongs to the warmup prefill, whose
  shape is nobody's choice -- **-14.7%** on one configuration. `Recorded` takes
  that as a field with no default, and a recording that did not reset it
  refuses every term it took at a shape.
- **A term the run does not record.** Not a term of zero bytes. The refusal
  names it and, when the predicted side is declared, carries that term's own
  note -- which for buffers is the reason for recording them rather than
  computing them.
- **A term the run records as zero bytes.** An error relative to zero has no
  value, and the gate's unit is relative. So it refuses in the comparison
  rather than dividing, which also keeps it out of the renderer: one term that
  cannot state a relative error must not take the table down for the terms that
  can, in the module whose product *is* the table.

## The graph pool is two numbers and stays two

`graph_pool.reserves()` and `graph_pool.predicts()` disagree by 4-19x and only
the first reserves anything. `compare_graph_pool` reports **both** against the
recorded pool and labels which is which; there is no call here that returns one
of them, and `compare` refuses a footprint term carrying either name so the
pool cannot be folded into the per-term table as a single row.

    **What it deliberately does not carry, so that the absence is a decision
    rather than a hole.** There is no batch dimension: the footprint terms this
    package predicts are linear in tokens and none of them is a function of how

    distinction nothing here can act on. The consequence is real and worth
    stating -- two decode breakdowns at 256 tokens compare equal whatever the
