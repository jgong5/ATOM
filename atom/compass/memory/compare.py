"""A predicted non-KV footprint held to its gate one term at a time.

`03` D16's rule is **validate per term, never as a sum**, and the incident
behind it is the reason this module has no call that returns a total. A summed
non-KV check once read **+13.8%** while holding three errors, two of which
cancelled: weights over by **+0.280 GB** (a tied `lm_head` that is never
resident), activations compared at the wrong shape (**-0.015 GB**), and
**-0.084 GB** of a resident term nobody had noticed existed. The largest of the
three was **25% of its own term**, and the sum said 13.8%.

So this module compares term by term, and the aggregate is available only as a
`SummedCheck`, which cannot be constructed without the comparison it summarises
and renders the per-term table underneath itself. That is principle 7 made
structural rather than remembered, the same way `terms.Reading` makes it
structural for a reading.

**It costs no GPU time.** Every hardware run already prints its own breakdown;
a `Recorded` is that printout, handed in as input data. Nothing here runs a
model, imports the engine or touches a device, and a comparator that needed one
would be a comparator nobody could run against the card they are sizing for.

## What a term can come back as

| outcome | when |
|---|---|
| `Verdict.PASS` | both sides present, within the gate, and the predicted side was obtained |
| `Verdict.FAIL` | both sides present and outside the gate -- **including** when the predicted side is a declared coefficient, because a recording that contradicts a coefficient is evidence |
| `Verdict.NOT_DISCHARGED` | both sides present and within the gate, but the predicted side is a declared coefficient. Agreement with one run does not turn a coefficient into a measurement, so the error is reported and the gate is not called discharged |
| a `TermRefusal` | the two sides cannot be compared at all: the run records no such term, the shapes disagree, or the recorded peak is the warmup prefill's |

The asymmetry in the middle two rows is deliberate and it is the whole of
principle 6 applied to a gate: a declared term can **fail** its gate but cannot
**pass** it. `03` D16 says so for two of the three terms it owes -- weights are
exact via a meta build and buffers are recorded, not formula'd -- and its open
issue says so for the third: "a graph without the scratch table does not
discharge the 10% gate on this term".

## The three traps this module refuses rather than papers over

- **Shape.** Both sides state the shape they were taken at and a term taken at
  a shape refuses against a side taken at another. The -0.015 GB above is an
  activation term compared at the wrong shape, and a comparison that does not
  say what shape it is at cannot notice.
- **The allocator's high-water mark.** A tracing run must reset it around the
  step it writes a graph for, or the peak belongs to the warmup prefill, whose
  shape is nobody's choice -- **-14.7%** on one configuration. `Recorded` takes
  that as a field with no default, and a recording that did not reset it
  refuses every term it took at a shape.
- **A term the run does not record.** Not a term of zero bytes. The refusal
  names it and, when the predicted side is declared, carries that term's own
  note -- which for buffers is `03` D16's reason for recording them rather than
  computing them.

## The graph pool is two numbers and stays two

`graph_pool.reserves()` and `graph_pool.predicts()` disagree by 4-19x and only
the first reserves anything. `compare_graph_pool` reports **both** against the
recorded pool and labels which is which; there is no call here that returns one
of them, and `compare` refuses a footprint term carrying either name so the
pool cannot be folded into the per-term table as a single row.
