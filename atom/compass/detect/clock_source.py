"""A static pass for reads of a real clock on the simulated path.

Time on the simulated path comes from the run's own clock. A call to the
machine's clock returns real seconds, and real seconds put into a record of
modelled ones are not visibly different from the modelled ones -- the number
has the right magnitude, the table still adds up, and the only sign of trouble
is that two timestamps on one timeline disagree by a margin nobody is looking
for. So this is a static check: the read is a failure on the day it is written,
not on the day a number taken off it is argued about.

Reads are found by parsing rather than by matching text, because the forms that
matter are not all spelled the same. `from time import monotonic` followed by a
bare `monotonic()` is the same read as `time.monotonic()`, and a text search for
the second does not find the first. Imports and the aliases assigned from them
are resolved to the name they came from, and the call target is compared against
that -- so `now = time.monotonic` followed by `now()` is found as well, a form a
text search for the assignment *would* have found and an earlier parse of only
the imports did not.

**What this pass does not see.** Naming the blind spots is part of the check,
because a check whose limits are unstated gets read as a guarantee:

* a read reached through a string -- `getattr(time, "perf_counter")()`, or
  `importlib.import_module("time")` -- because the name is not in the syntax;
* `from time import *`, because the names it binds are in the module it imports
  and not in this one's text;
* a name bound to the result of a call rather than to a name, since only a
  dotted name on the right of an assignment is followed;
* scope: a name bound anywhere in the file is treated as bound everywhere in
  it, so a local alias in one function is resolved in another;
* **a clock handed around as a value rather than assigned to a name.** Only an
  import and a plain assignment are followed, so a parameter default
  (`def step(wall_clock=time.monotonic)`), a walrus, a tuple unpacking, a class
  attribute read back through the class, a dict entry read back by subscript
  and a `functools.partial` all carry the clock past this pass. They are one
  class -- the callable is bound somewhere the parser does not follow and
  called later -- and the parameter default is the form that appears in real
  code, which is also why a bare attribute load is not treated as a read.

Each of those is a read this pass would miss and a reviewer would not, which is
the trade the pass is worth making and not a reason to trust it alone. The list
is what has been tried against it, not an enumeration of what Python allows.

**The allow-list is part of the check, not an escape from it.** A read that is
meant to stay real gets an entry naming its file, or its site and class, and the
reason, so the list is reviewable, and adding to it is a decision somebody
writes down rather than a silence.
