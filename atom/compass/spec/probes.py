"""What a probe that needs no device emits, and which probe fills which constant.

The first half of this module is the tier that needs no device; the second is
the table of which probe supplies each runtime constant, and the one entry that
no probe supplies. The reading that makes two fragments comparable comes first.

A probe measures part of a machine and emits a fragment: the fields it measured
plus the stanza saying which machine they are for, by whom, when and how. What
is here is the composing half of the tier that needs no device -- the tokenizer
rates arrive as an argument, from whoever measured them -- and a tokenizer
sweep needs no device, so it is the measurement most likely to be taken
somewhere other than the machine it is authored for -- a laptop, a build agent,
the login node in front of a cluster. That is not an abuse of it. Tokenization
is single-threaded, cache-resident integer work, so the rates transfer across
processors of comparable class, and refusing every spec not authored on its own
target would refuse most specs that will ever be written.

**So a fragment composed here writes down the processor this ran on, and that
is the whole of its second job.** `host.cpu.cores_physical` and
`host.cpu.cores_logical` are already required fields of the machine, so a
fragment that fills them in is claiming that the host that composed it is the
machine its stanza names. When it is not
-- the tokenizer measured on the laptop, the device fields measured on the node,
both authored for the node -- the two fragments then state different numbers for
one field of one machine, and the merge refuses the pair with both readings and
both stanzas. Before this they shared no field at all: nothing in a fragment's
shape says where it was measured, so nothing contradicted anything, and the pair
combined into a document that describes neither host. Two fields that were
already required, and nothing added to the schema, are what turn that silence
into a refusal.

This does not make the transfer illegitimate, and it does not record where the
probe ran -- no field of a fragment does that. A tokenizer measured on a
comparable processor is still the intended use. What changes is that an author
who wants it now has to write the target's own core counts into the document,
rather than have the question go unasked.

**The counts come from the kernel's per-processor topology, and are refused
rather than guessed.** The physical count is the number of distinct
package-and-core pairs; the logical count is the number of processors. They
differ by the simultaneous-multithreading factor, so deriving either from the
other would be wrong by exactly the factor that makes the pair worth recording.
A host that publishes no topology, or one that publishes a file holding nothing
a number can be read out of, gets a refusal naming what could not be read: a
count taken off an unreadable file is a reading with no content behind it, and
it would travel into a spec looking exactly like a measurement.

**The rates are the caller's, and so is the claim about how they were
obtained.** This function composes a fragment and reads a topology. It does not
encode or decode anything, so it cannot know whether the rates it was handed
were swept on a loaded tokenizer, copied out of an older spec or typed in -- and
`provenance.method` is what a merge refusal quotes and what a run artifact
carries as the numbers' source. A method stamped here would be this function
asserting a measurement it did not take, over data it received. So the caller
states it, with no default to fall through to, and the core counts read here
ride along under whatever the caller states about its own rates.

**What the entries are is checked here rather than several verbs later.** They
are read against the closed table a tokenizer entry has, the same one a spec is
read against, so an entry that is not a tokenizer, or one missing the derate its
two rates oblige, is refused while the probe that produced it is still the thing
in front of the author. Left to `validate`, the same entry is refused after a
merge, in a document whose other fields came from elsewhere, and the fragment
that carried it has to be worked back to.

**Which probe fills which runtime constant, and the one entry that has none.**
The runtime constants keyed by tensor-parallel width are the terms with no law
behind them, so a width nobody measured is refused by name rather than
interpolated, and the remedy such a refusal offers is to go and run a probe.
`FILLED_BY` records which probe that is. Two of them fill these terms: one
starts a single engine on one card and reads the device's own reserve off it,
and one starts an engine per width above one and reads both width-keyed terms
at each. Between them they do not cover the allocator's retained bytes at width
one, and that hole is written here as a hole. The single-card probe is
specified to fill the reserve term and not this one; the multi-rank probe is
specified for the widths above one. Handing the entry to either would be
writing a capability into the table that nothing states, and a table entry
invented to close a gap travels onward as a measurement -- so asking for that
entry's probe returns a refusal naming what has to be measured by hand instead.

**And the hole is not a tier boundary somebody forgot to move.** The retained
bytes measure 1.1e6 at width one and 2.17e9 flat at every width above it,
because what is retained above one card is a collective staging pool that does
not exist on a single card. Running the multi-rank probe at width one would
therefore not be the same probe measuring a smaller number; it would be
measuring a different quantity and writing it under the same name. Which of the
two probes should own this entry, or whether it stays hand-measured, is a
decision about what each probe is specified to fill, and it is not one this
table can take on its own.

**A width is a count of cards, so the domain starts at one.** `FILLED_BY` says
which probe fills a constant at width one and above it, and there is nothing
below that for either probe to describe: no engine starts on zero cards, and a
negative width is not a deployment. So a non-positive width is refused by name
rather than answered with the probe that happens to sit on the other side of
the width-one test. That test is the only place a width reaches this module
from a caller instead of from a document, where the schema has already refused
it.
