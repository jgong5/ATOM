"""One reading taken on every rank, reduced to the single number a spec carries.

A memory reading is taken per rank, and the ranks of a symmetric group do
identical work, so the ranks are repetitions of one measurement and the spec
wants one number out of them. Which number is not a detail.

**The minimum is the reading -- of a reading the whole device shares.** A
device-wide reading counts every process on the card, so a rank whose card also
carries somebody else's work reads high by whatever the neighbour holds. No rank
ever reads *low* for that reason, which makes the smallest reading the one least
contaminated by a process that has nothing to do with this engine.

That argument is a property of the reading, not of this reduction, and it does
not reach every term the spec keys by width.
`driver_and_collective_reserve_bytes` is read off the device and is the one it
was measured on. `allocator_retained_after_load_bytes` is torch-allocator bytes,
i.e. per process: a neighbour cannot inflate it, ranks doing identical work
should simply agree, and the failure that *is* available -- a rank read before
its weight loading had settled -- reads **low**, where taking the minimum keeps
the under-measurement and hands it on as more KV budget than exists. The spread
looks the same either way. The same holds for anything rate-shaped: readings of
`[8, 8, 8, 7]` TB/s are a 14.3% spread, accepted, and 7.0e12 is what is kept.
So the contract of this function is narrower than its signature: it is the right
reduction where contamination can only read high, the caller is choosing it for
that reason rather than inheriting it, and a per-process or rate-shaped reading
wants a reduction this module does not provide.

**The spread is reported, never folded away.** Taking a minimum and reporting
only that hides the disagreement, and the disagreement is the single-run
measurement of how quiet the machine was. The spread across ranks is
legitimately non-zero: it was measured at zero for one and two ranks, 192 MiB
across four and 640 MiB across eight, on a machine with nothing else on it. A
tool that refused those would be refusing the hardware for behaving as the
hardware behaves.

**Above a threshold it is refused.** The spread that matters is not a few per
cent. The case this exists to catch is a neighbour holding 152 GB against a
rank's own 2.9 GB, which is a factor of fifty and not a fraction; six runs died
at start-up on a negative memory budget because nothing looked at it. So the
limit sits well above the widest honest spread and far below the hazard: 640
MiB in about 10.4 GiB is six per cent of the smallest reading, and
`SPREAD_LIMIT` accepts four times that while still declining the fifty-fold
case by two orders of magnitude. It is a parameter because it is a judgement
about how quiet a machine has to be, and whoever is running the machine is
better placed to make it than this module is.

Two things the limit does not do, both narrower than the paragraph above would
suggest on its own. It is **not an accuracy bound on the number kept**: taking
the minimum has already discarded the contaminated rank, so a single rank
carrying an extra 2.8 GB at width 8 passes here and does no harm downstream.
What the limit asserts is that the machine was quiet enough for any rank to be
believed at all -- a quietness assertion, not an error bar -- and a tighter one
would only refuse readings whose minimum was fine. And it is **differential**,
so it cannot see common-mode contamination: eight ranks each reading 2.5 GB high
have a spread of zero and carry the 2.5 GB into the spec unremarked. The design
pairs this check with an absolute one -- refuse a reading that far exceeds what
the collective terms predict for its width -- and the two are only jointly
sufficient. That one needs a probe to have read `free` and `total` separately,
so it is not here, and it is recorded as left undone rather than assumed.

The readings themselves are checked the way the schema checks a quantity, so a
reading that could never be written into a spec is declined here, where the
ranks that produced it are still in hand, rather than later where they are not.
