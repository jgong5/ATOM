"""What a spec is checked for, and why every reason is reported at once.

A spec is authored by hand against a schema most of whose terms cannot be looked
up anywhere, so the document a person first writes is nearly always incomplete.
The whole value of checking it is that an incomplete one is refused rather than
quietly completed: a term nobody measured has no default, because a default here
is a guess with a number's authority, and it will be discovered by a run rather
than by the person who could still go and measure it.

Refusals are collected, not raised one at a time. Reading a document stops at
the first thing wrong with it, which is right for a reader that has to produce a
value and wrong for a check whose reader is filling in a form: told one missing
field per attempt, they measure one term, run again, and find the next. So the
answer is the list, in the schema's own order, and a caller that wants an
exception raises the first.

The check has two halves. The first asks whether the document is a complete
instance of the schema -- every required field present and every value the shape
its field declares. The second asks whether what it describes is consistent:
whether the widths the deployment will actually use were measured, whether the
stack the constants were taken on is the stack now loaded, and whether constants
carried over from another spec came from one pinned to the same stack.

**The second half is asked of whatever resolved, and not only of a complete
spec.** Those questions are not intrinsically about a resolved document, only
their implementation was: both width tables are present and schema-valid in a
document that the first half refuses for a single missing derate, and that
derate is a value its author types in at a desk. Running the second half only
when the first came back clear therefore hid the expensive refusal -- a width
nobody measured, which costs an eight-GPU reservation to fix -- behind the cheap
one, and reintroduced at the halfway line exactly the one-refusal-per-attempt
this module opens by rejecting. So each question is asked of the fields that did
check out, and a question that reads a field which did not resolve says so by
name rather than being passed over in silence.

**That holds for the schema half too, so the walk over the document collects.**
A key the table does not declare, or a block holding a scalar where the schema
has fields, is one refusal about one key -- and reading the document stops
there, which would leave every other field unchecked and every consistency
question with nothing resolved to be asked of. A typo in a hand-authored
document is the cheapest fix there is, and it would have hidden the width
nobody measured behind itself. So the walk yields its refusals and carries on,
and the document is checked field by field whatever it holds elsewhere.

**The same record makes the opt-in conditions legible.** Four of the six in
`CONDITIONS` need something from the caller -- two of them `tp_widths=`, one
`observed_stack=`, and one a `Merge` rather than a document -- and a clear
result that does not say what it declined to ask is the shape this package
exists to refuse. The sharpest case is the transfer: its source's pin is in no
field of the merged document, by the decision below, so `validate(document)`
can never ask that condition however the document was built, and the same spec
is refused as a `Merge` and clear as a document. That is not a wrong number,
but it must be visible, because a caller that holds only the document cannot
ask it. Merging the document again does not recover the pin: a merge whose
fragments disagree on a method states `mixed`, so a `Merge` holding the saved
document reports the transfer as not asked too, or as asked only in part when
another fragment states a transfer and a stack pin resolved. A `validate` verb
over a machine file -- `compass spec validate machine.yaml` -- is not built
yet: no entry point names it, and nothing in this package reads a spec file.
This module is what it would call. `CONDITIONS` is what a count of reach is a
count of; a condition added to the check set and not to it is one no result
can report on.

**The reach of a document is `ASKABLE_OF_A_DOCUMENT`, which is a value and not
a sentence.** Writing the number down in prose here puts a person between the
check set and the statement about it: the set changes, nobody rereads the
paragraph, and the package goes on claiming a reach it no longer has. So the
statement is the tuple below, a run's own `not_asked` is asserted against it,
and a condition that becomes askable of a document -- or one that stops being
-- fails a test rather than quietly contradicting a docstring.

**What was asked of only part of its fields is reported apart from what was not
asked at all.** A question whose fields all failed to resolve was not asked and
must not be counted as reach. A question asked of two width tables where only
one resolved *was* asked, and can already have earned a refusal; filing it under
"not asked" would report a refusal the run did make as a question it did not,
and would subtract it from the count of what the run reached. Both are results
and neither is the other, so they are two fields of the record.

**A width nobody measured is two questions, not one.** The first is whether the
document carries it, and the remedy that refusal offers is to go and measure it.
The second is whether anything here would measure it, and for one entry -- the
allocator's retained bytes on a single card -- the answer is no: the single-card
probe fills the other width-keyed term, and the multi-rank one starts above
width one. So for that entry the first remedy cannot be followed with the tools
this package ships, and a check that stopped at the first question would leave
an author hunting a probe that does not exist. The second is asked only where
the entry is absent: a spec that carries the number, measured by hand, is a good
spec and is not refused for how it was obtained.

Three of those questions need something the document does not carry, and the two
about widths need the same thing.

**The widths a deployment will use are ATOM's, not the spec's.** The spec
describes a machine and says nothing about how the engine was launched, so the
widths come in as an argument, from the engine's own configuration. A spec that
measured widths 1 and 2 is complete and correct, and is still the wrong spec for
a run at width 8 -- which is a fact about the pair, not about the document.

**A transferred constant is checked against its source's stack pin.** The
fragment that carried it declares the stack the source spec was pinned to, which
is why the merge keeps that declaration aside instead of contributing it. Here
the two are compared, and a transfer out of a differently-pinned spec is refused
by name. A transfer that declares no stack at all is refused too: the evidence
that these constants move with the compute stack is the whole reason a transfer
is allowed to be cheap, and a transfer that does not say what it was measured
against cannot be checked by anyone, ever.

A stack mismatch on the running machine is the one finding that is not fatal by
default. The numbers are still measurements, taken on a stack that has since
moved, and whether that matters is a judgement about how far it moved -- so it
warns and names both versions, and refuses only when the caller asks for that.
