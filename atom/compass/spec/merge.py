"""Fragments combined into one spec, and the check that is the point of it.

A probe measures part of a machine and emits a **fragment**: a partial document
plus the stanza that says which machine it is for, by whom, when and how.
Combining fragments is arithmetic over dotted paths and would need very little
said about it. The conflict check is why this module exists.

**One spec describes one host, and nothing about a fragment's shape says which
host it came from.** Two tokenizers measured on two different CPUs contradict
nothing: they have different identities, they occupy different entries, no field
of one overlaps a field of the other, and a merge that only compared values
would combine them into a single document that describes no machine at all. The
error is then invisible for as long as the spec lives, and every number derived
from it is wrong by however far the two hosts differ. So a fragment states the
machine it claims to be for, the merge refuses two fragments that name different
machines, and the refusal prints both stanzas rather than the bare names -- what
a reader needs is which two measurements are being combined, not that a string
comparison failed.

**What that arm compares is the declared name, not the host.** `name` is the
machine the spec is being *authored for* -- `mi355x-8gpu-2node` is a class, not
a host -- and no field of a fragment records where a probe actually ran. So a
tokenizer fragment measured on a laptop and a device fragment measured on the
node, both authored `name: node-18`, pass this arm: it compares what they claim
and a claim is not evidence. The claim it can carry is therefore narrower than
the one above -- the fragments agree about which machine they are *for*,
corroborated by nothing except their overlap. The overlap is where that pair is
caught, and it is the second arm's business: the tokenizer probe writes the core
counts of the processor it ran on into two fields the schema already required,
so the laptop and the node now disagree about `host.cpu.cores_physical`, 8
against 96, and are refused with both readings. Until the probe emitted them the
pair shared no field at all, so the second arm had nothing to contradict and the
exact pair this module opens by naming merged into a document describing neither
host. Closing that residue took no schema field, and it is closed from the
probe's side rather than here.

The second arm catches the same hazard from the other side. Two fragments that
name one machine and disagree about one of its fields cannot both be true of it,
whatever their stanzas say, so a differing value is refused with both readings
and both stanzas. Between them the arms cover the mislabelled fragment and the
unlabelled contradiction, which are the two ways a multi-host spec is authored.

Three kinds of field are combined rather than compared, because contributing
part of one is what a probe does:

* a **runtime constant keyed by width** is combined per width, since the widths
  come from different probe runs -- one rank's engine start fills width 1, and
  the multi-rank run fills the rest. Two fragments measuring the same width
  differently are still a conflict.
* the **tokenizer table** is combined per entry, keyed by the identity and the
  implementation the rates were measured on. Two entries sharing an identity
  must agree about the file they measured; one name over two files is the drift
  that keying by tokenizer exists to prevent.
* the **provenance** block is rebuilt rather than merged. It names every
  fragment that went in, carries the latest date, and states one method only
  when the fragments agree on one -- a spec built from a datasheet and an engine
  run is honestly `mixed` and not either of them. Because a merged document is
  itself a legal fragment, incremental authoring -- merge, save, merge next
  week's probe into it -- would otherwise drop the names of the fragments that
  built the saved document, in the one block whose job is to say where the
  numbers came from. So any `provenance.fragments` a fragment already states is
  carried forward ahead of its own source name. "Latest" is the lexicographic
  maximum of the dates as written: the field is text, ISO-shaped dates order
  correctly under it, and `'2026-9-9'` does not.

Constants that were transferred from another spec are the exception to combining
values. Such a fragment carries the stack the *source* spec was pinned to, which
is provenance about the constants and not a claim about this machine's stack, so
it is kept aside for checking rather than contributed. Merging it as though it
described this host would install the source's ROCm version as this one's and
silence the check that exists to catch exactly that.

The result is a document, not a spec. A merge produces what the fragments
happened to cover, and whether that is a complete and consistent machine is a
separate question with its own answer.
