"""Tokenizer rates, keyed by the tokenizer rather than by the model.

Keying by model is the obvious design and the wrong one. Models share
tokenizers routinely -- every size in a family ships the same one, and
distillations and fine-tunes inherit it -- so a model-keyed table measures one
tokenizer once per model and stores N copies of one number. The copies then
drift, and the drift is invisible, because nothing ever compares them. Keying by
the tokenizer stores the number once and lists the architectures that resolve to
it, so there is nothing to disagree.

Four fields carry the identity, and each earns its place:

* `id` is author-chosen, stable and human-readable. It is what two specs being
  combined conflict on, so it has to be a name a person picked rather than a
  hash they would not recognise.
* `backend` is in the key because the Rust and Python implementations run an
  order of magnitude apart on the same `tokenizer.json`, and which one loads is
  decided by the environment, not by the model. A spec measured on one says
  nothing about the other, so resolution takes the backend that actually loaded
  and refuses when only the other was measured -- falling back to whichever
  entry exists would report a tenfold-wrong number with no indication.
* `fingerprint` is the sha256 of the `tokenizer.json` that was measured. It is
  the check that the rates belong to this tokenizer and not to a revision of it.
* `applies_to` is the list of model architectures that resolve to this entry.
  One entry, many models: this is where the sharing is written down.

Resolution refuses rather than defaulting, and the size of the error is why. A
p50 prompt in the traces this is calibrated against is 88,768 tokens; at a
couple of million tokens a second that is tens of milliseconds, several times
the whole admission constant, and all of it lands inside time to first token.
A default would be wrong by an amount that scales with prompt length while
looking like a constant.

A fingerprint mismatch warns instead of refusing: the rates are still the right
tokenizer's, measured against a different revision of its file, so the number is
usable and the discrepancy is the user's to judge. A missing architecture is not
usable at all.
