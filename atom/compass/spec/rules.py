"""What a refusal says, and the one list that makes an unknown key legible.

A refusal here is a result, not an error path, so it is built to be read by
whoever hit it. Three parts, always: which rule declined, what in the document
tripped it, and what would satisfy it. A message that names only the first two
tells a user their spec is wrong and leaves them to guess the fix, and the fix
is the only part they need.

The same reading decides how many refusals there are. Three different things
can stop a dotted path resolving and they want three different actions, so
there are three refusals and not one. A key with no row in the field table is a
typo or a knob that belongs to the deployment. A declared field this object
holds no value for is the schema's own field in a spec assembled from parts. A
path that names a block names a group of fields rather than a value, which is
the one of the three a reader can act on without changing anything. A single
message would be true of whichever case it was written against and would send
the other two readers to the schema to find what they asked for sitting there.

The separation rule is the one that decides every inclusion question:

    the spec describes the machine; ATOM's config describes the deployment;
    anything ATOM could configure belongs to ATOM, and Compass reads it there.

It is enforced by the schema being **closed** rather than by the list below. A
document key that is not a declared field is refused wherever it sits, so a
spec cannot carry a tensor-parallel width, a block size or a memory-utilisation
fraction even though no rule anywhere names them -- and it equally cannot carry
the next such knob, which nobody has thought to list yet. A denylist would have
to be complete to work; a closed schema is complete by construction.

`DEPLOYMENT_OWNED` exists only to improve the message. When the unknown key is
one of the knobs a spec author is most likely to reach for, the refusal says
where ATOM configures it instead of saying merely that it is unrecognised. The
values name engine-argument fields rather than command-line flags because the
field names are what a test can check against the engine's own surface, and a
list that drifts away from that surface would be folklore inside a month.
