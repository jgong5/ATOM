"""The schema as data: every field the machine spec has, and what it may hold.

The table is the schema. Reading a document means checking it against this and
nothing else, which is what makes the schema closed -- a key with no row here is
refused wherever it sits, so the separation rule holds without anyone
maintaining a list of the knobs it excludes.

Four things about the table are load-bearing.

**A spec-peak number is marked, and its derate is derived from the mark.** No
row declares a derate. `closed()` adds one to the block of every field marked
`peak`, so a number that came off a datasheet cannot be added without also
requiring the haircut that turns it into an achievable one. Listing the derates
by hand would let the two drift: a new peak term would be accepted with no
derate, which is exactly the quiet datasheet-as-achievable the rule exists to
stop. Five derates come out of the four blocks here plus the one in a tokenizer
entry, and none of them is written down.

**A runtime constant keyed by tensor-parallel width is a table, not a law.** The
measured values at widths 1, 2, 4 and 8 fit no fixed-plus-per-peer form, so
there is nothing to interpolate along and a width that was not measured cannot
be produced from the widths that were. `WIDTH_TABLE` holds what was measured and
the accessor refuses the rest by name.

**A checked value is the spec's own.** Every kind returns a copy rather than
what the document handed over: `tuple` for a list of names, `dict` for a width
table, and a walk for a tokenizer entry, which holds mappings and lists of its
own where the other two hold scalars. A frozen spec that aliased its caller's
document would have a digest that moves afterwards, under an artifact that
already recorded it.

**Types are checked positively.** A count is an `int` that is not a `bool`, a
quantity is a positive real, a derate is a fraction in (0, 1]. `bool` is an
`int` in Python, so a check that only asked for an integer would accept `True`
as a core count; and a quantity that is allowed to be zero or negative turns a
division in a cost term into an infinity or a negative duration far from here.

Everything in the table is required. A machine has an interconnect whether or
not a particular run drives it, and the value of refusing a missing term is that
the refusal happens while a person is authoring the document rather than in the
middle of a simulated run. The two exceptions are the provenance fields `merge`
fills in later.
