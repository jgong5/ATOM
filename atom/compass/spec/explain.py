"""Where a number came from: the spec fields under it, and who measured them.

A run artifact carries the whole resolved spec, which makes every number it
reports recoverable in principle. This is what makes it recoverable in practice.
The reader has one quantity and one question -- what is this built out of -- and
the answer is the fields that feed it, each with the value the document holds,
the haircut applied to it, and the fragment that supplied it.

**It is a decomposition and never a total.** A summed check over these terms
once read +13.8% while hiding three separate errors, two of which cancelled and
the largest of which was a quarter of a single term. So each field is reported
on its own line in its own unit, and nothing here adds them up. The arithmetic
that combines them belongs to whatever consumes them, and a sum taken across
seconds, bytes and bytes-per-second would be a fiction anyway.

**A spec-peak number is shown twice, with the derate between them.** That is the
one decomposition this module can always do, and it is the one most worth doing:
the gap between a datasheet figure and what a kernel reaches is a declared
judgement, not a measurement, and a reader tracing an over-optimistic prediction
wants to see the declared figure beside the derated one rather than a single
number that is silently either.

Two ways to name what to explain. A **field** or a block of fields is named by
its dotted path, and is exact -- there is nothing to maintain and nothing to
drift. A **quantity** is named out of `QUANTITIES`, which lists the spec fields
each predicted quantity is built from; that is the spec half of the relationship
and the only half this package can see, so it is checked for naming real fields
and nothing more. A consumer that reaches for a term this table does not list
for it is the thing to fix, in the table.

A width-keyed constant explains at the width asked for, or at every width that
was measured when no width is given; asking at a width nobody measured is
refused by name, here as everywhere else. Tokenizer rates explain per entry and
per rate, because a spec holding two tokenizers has two different answers and a
reader tracing a tokenization cost needs to see which of them was used.
