"""The stand-in model's KV geometry, checked by what ATOM does with it.

The geometry itself is a handful of multiplications, and a test that only
re-derives them proves nothing: it would pass against a number the engine
refuses. So every claim below is made by handing the geometry to the code
that consumes it for real -- `page_pool` and `plan_pools` from
`atom.model_ops.attentions`, `BlockManager` from `atom.model_engine`, ATOM's
own pipeline partitioner, and Compass's own clock registry -- and reading the
answer back out of those.

The model is the published Qwen3.8-27B config, vendored beside this file so
the numbers are reproducible without a checkout of the weights. It is a
hybrid: 64 layers of which 16 are full attention, so only those 16 hold paged
KV, and it has 4 KV heads, which is what makes the grouped-query bound visible
at the widths a real deployment uses. At 8 ranks those 4 heads cannot be cut
into 8, so they are replicated and a rank's KV stops shrinking. A geometry
that divided by the width would claim twice the blocks there.

What is deliberately not asserted: agreement with a real run's block count.
The double leaves out the fp32 scale plane the aiter backends carry and sizes
no recurrent state, so its numbers are smaller than a real model's by a
declared amount. What it has to get right is that the count moves, correctly,
with the width.

One asymmetry to carry forward. At one pipeline stage the 16 can be checked
against the engine twice over -- it is the count of full-attention entries in
the config, and it is also `num_hidden_layers // full_attention_interval`,
which is what the GDN builder sizes its paged pool from. At more than one
stage there is no such check available, because ATOM's own GDN path mixes a
pipeline-local layer count with a global one there and sizes a negative
block. The four-per-stage figure below is the intended semantics and is
right; it is not agreement with a live engine, and nothing here claims it is.
