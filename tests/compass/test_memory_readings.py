"""The five device readings, taken off a spec, with the device readings broken.

Every test here runs with `torch.cuda.mem_get_info` and
`torch.cuda.memory_stats` replaced by functions that raise. That is the point of
the fixture and not a precaution: the claim this task makes is that no reading
comes off a card, and a claim of that shape is worth what it costs to falsify.
It is checked twice over and the two checks fail differently -- the patch would
catch a call made at run time, and `test_the_package_imports_no_device` catches
one that could be made at all, by reading the import graph of every module in
the package. A module that never imports torch cannot call it, however the
branches fall.

The model is the vendored Qwen3.8-27B config, as `test_backend_kv_geometry.py`
uses it, so the geometry here and the KV geometry there are the same model. The
spec is a complete MI355X document written out below rather than imported from
the spec tests, because the named result is meant to be readable beside its
inputs.

Two things are asserted as byte counts rather than as properties, because the
named result of this task is a per-term table and a table nobody checked is a
claim. The terms that come off the spec are asserted at their exact values, and
so is the clean-box identity that produces `free`.
