"""Which layer count a collective is charged on, shown on two configs at once.

A worker is described by two layer counts. `geometry.layers` counts the layers
that hold a cache of every past token, which is what a KV block is sized from;
`stage_layers` counts the layers the worker runs, which is what an all-reduce
runs on -- a layer keeping a bounded recurrent state takes part in the
collective and costs a block nothing. The published hybrid here is one paged
layer in four, so its two counts are 16 and 64.

One config cannot show this. On a dense stack every layer is paged, the two
counts are the same number, and a charge on either is the same seconds: a price
computed from the wrong count is right by coincidence and nothing distinguishes
it. So both configs are priced here side by side, and the pair is the assertion
-- equal on the dense one, four times apart on the hybrid.

The counts are read back out of the priced step rather than restated: the
collective term is `tokens x layers x a declared coefficient`, so dividing the
charge by the tokens and the coefficient recovers the count the pricing used.
A test that asserted the seconds instead would pass against either count with
the arithmetic adjusted, which is the thing being guarded against.

Nothing here is an accuracy check. The coefficient behind every duration below
was declared, not measured, and a ratio between two of them is a statement
about which count was multiplied and not about any hardware.
