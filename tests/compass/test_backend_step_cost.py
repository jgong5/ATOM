"""A step's total, and the parts it is folded from.

Three properties are asserted structurally rather than by inspection. The
total is not stored: it is folded from the terms on every read, and the terms
are re-checked on every read, so an object edited past its constructor fails
when it is used rather than reporting a tidy number. A subclass cannot shadow
the total, because overriding a property needs no bypass at all and is the one
route to a plausible number that has nothing to do with its breakdown. And the
fold order is fixed and observable -- the same terms in a different order are
a different number, bit for bit.

The empty-sample refusal is asserted at both layers it can appear. Inside a
step it is an empty breakdown; over a run it is a fraction with no data behind
it, which matters more, because "refused nothing" and "recorded nothing" would
otherwise be the same number at the point where that number decides whether a
run is worth anything.
