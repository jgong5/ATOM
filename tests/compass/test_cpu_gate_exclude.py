"""`scripts/compass/cpu_gate_exclude.txt`: the list the CPU test gate trusts.

The list names the ATOM tests that reach the driver, so `gate_cpu.sh` can skip
them and stay green without a GPU.

It has two sections, and the split is the point. The GENERATED section is
produced by iterating collection to a fixed point and is reproducible from the
tree. The MANUAL section is for files that *collect* cleanly and fail later on a
driver call -- invisible to a generator that greps collection errors, so they
cannot be derived and must be asserted, with the failure text that justifies
each one. Before the split, four entries had been hand-added to a file whose
header read "never hand-edit", and the list could not be reproduced from the
tree it described. These tests exist so that cannot recur silently.

The failure being guarded against is drift, and drift here is silent in the
direction that matters. A renamed or deleted ATOM test leaves a stale
`--ignore=` that pytest accepts without complaint, so the entry stops excluding
anything and the gate starts erroring at collection on a file nobody listed --
which reads as "your change broke collection".

Two of the parametrisations below take their argvalues from a file rather than
from a literal, and a parametrisation of nothing is a pass -- so each carries
something that states its own non-empty case, without which this file reports
green with its pins asserting nothing. The two statements are deliberately
different assertions. The trigger list must *exist*: a tree with no
`gpu_gate_triggers.txt` has lost the record of what the CPU tier cannot see, so
that guard refuses outright. The manual section is *allowed* to be empty --
nothing obliges a tree to hand-exclude anything -- so its guard pins the count,
which is what separates an emptiness somebody chose from one that arrived.

What is *not* asserted: that every listed file genuinely needs a driver. Proving
that means collecting each one in a driver-free container, which is
`regen_cpu_gate_exclude.sh`'s job, not a unit test's.
