"""Building a `BatchView` from a scheduled batch, and the rung it supplies.

The backend that prices a step is handed a projection, and two properties of
that projection are ones the type cannot hold: that there is one row per
request the scheduler scheduled, and that `capture_rung` is a width a graph was
captured at rather than a number somebody typed. Both belong to the builder, so
both are asserted here.

The batches are ATOM's own. A real `Scheduler` runs with chunked prefill
against a real block manager, and the run is driven long enough that its steps
include two-request prefill chunks, middle chunks with history behind them, and
decode. The same run is driven a second time under `pipeline_parallel_size=2`,
which is the one configuration in which the scheduler's sequences and its batch
disagree. Nothing is hand-built except the runner stand-in, which exists only
to carry a capture ladder and an eager flag, and the three-field sequence
snapshot described below.

Two things deliberately not re-derived here, because a re-derivation that
agrees with itself proves nothing: the per-request attention sums are compared
against `Scheduler.compute_detailed_aggregates`, and the rung against the
ladder search inside `ForwardMode.decide`.

**Why the sequences are snapshotted.** A `Sequence` keeps moving: the same
object that was mid-prefill at step 1 is decoding by step 9, so a test that
re-reads it at assertion time is reading a later step's state and not the one
its batch was built from. Each step therefore keeps the three fields the
projection reads, frozen at the moment the batch was built. The live objects
are kept too, and one test uses them for exactly that divergence.
