"""The artifact store: what names an entry, what made it, and what it refuses.

Every test here runs at **width two or more** wherever a width can matter. A
single rank cannot expose either of the two naming incidents as they happened: at
width one the failing code applied no suffix, so one writer and four writers
produced the same file and looked alike. The suffix here is unconditional --
that is this module's departure, and `test_the_bare_name_is_never_produced`
is what holds it -- but the four-ranks-one-file case still needs four ranks to
be visible at all, and every test that could pass at width one by accident is
run at width two as well.

Two things these tests deliberately do **not** do. They never bind an artifact
key's scalar `width` to a topology: at `-tp 2 -dp 2` the tensor-parallel width
and the rank count are 2 and 4, nothing says which the key field means, and a
fixture that picked one would settle by example a question filed as #165. The
multi-axis round trip is therefore keyed on `op_graph`, which has no width in
its key at all. And nothing here touches a driver, a device or a network:
`git` is reached only through an injected runner, so the source-root resolvers
are exercised without this tier depending on the tree it was staged from.

    The abandoned directory is named `.<entry>.publishing` on purpose: that is

    something to find and `shutil.rmtree` away. An earlier version of this test
    called it `.crashed`, which no version of the code ever touched -- it
    passed with the fix and passed reverted, and proved nothing.

    The directory must come out with its contents as they were, not merely

    into another publisher's staging just the same, and `is_dir()` alone
