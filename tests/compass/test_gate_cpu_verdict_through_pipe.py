"""`gate_cpu.sh`'s verdict has to survive being piped, and say why.

A pipeline's status is its last command's, so `gate_cpu.sh | tail -6` hands
the caller tail's 0 whatever the gate exited. The script cannot change that.
What it controls is the text: its last line is the verdict, and that line has
to carry the reason, because the three common pipes keep different halves of
the output -- `2>/dev/null | tail -6` drops every stderr line, which on a run
that exits 98 leaves the verdict number under pytest's green summary.

Each case runs the real script over a throwaway tree: a one-test suite, an
empty exclusion list, and a trigger list that the stamped diff touches, so the
run is green and then exits 98 for the GPU tier. Nothing needs a driver.
