"""compass_harness's traffic LP against the Clock Authority.

The trace tests serve a Clock Authority in this process with an idle engine
LP and a stand-in frontend LP. The frontend thread also stands in for the
aiperf worker: it reads the published stamps, reports each stream event it
sends and hands each final event's credit return to the router. aiperf's
strategy is a stand-in that schedules the next turn a fixed delay after a
return, on a ``ClockPacedLoopScheduler`` paced by the traffic LP. The hold
tests replace the authority with a scripted runtime, so a return can be put
on either side of its final event's release. Skips by name as
``test_harness_pacing.py`` does.
