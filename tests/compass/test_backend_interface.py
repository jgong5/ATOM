"""The backend seam itself: two methods, and what it is not allowed to reach.

`estimate` takes a projection of the batch -- numbers the caller prepared --
rather than the scheduled batch object, and the value of that choice is only
real if the package stays free of engine imports. So it is asserted by reading
the sources rather than trusted: a package that imports the engine is testable
only where the engine imports, which on this project means a machine with a
driver, which is where a cheap test stops being run.

The scan walks this package recursively, so a module added under it is covered
the day it is added. It reads nothing outside it, which is the limit worth
stating: the property is a property of a *package*, not something a type
inherits by being passed across the seam. Whoever defines the projection type
somewhere else owns the same assertion over the package that defines it.

Walking a root that does not resolve yields nothing, and a parametrisation of
nothing is a pass. So the non-empty case is asserted on its own: without it a
renamed or moved package collects zero cases and this file reports green, which
is the one outcome a test whose job is to pin something must not have.

    takes its imports out of the scan's reach, and the types listed here are
    the ones whose leaving would matter -- everything this package hands out

    What this catches that the scan does not is one case: a move to a package
    that is not `atom.*` at all. The scan filters on
    `module.split(".")[0] == "atom"` and skips a third-party module entirely,
    so a listed type moved to a vendor package fails here and nowhere else. A
    move that stays under `atom.*` fails the scan too, and there this is a
    second voice on the same fact rather than a new guarantee.

    What it does not catch, and what no import scan can: a config type defined
    beside the engine that reaches `FakeModel` as an argument.
    `FakeModel.__init__(self, config, ...)` is unannotated and reads attribute
    names off whatever it is handed, so that route needs no import in this
    package and leaves nothing here to read. It was tried; neither guard
    fires. The route is open, and closing it needs an instrument that reads
