"""The seam ATOM's KV budget is sized through, and the record it produces.

Everything here runs without a driver. The block count itself cannot: sizing a
pool means executing `ModelRunner.get_num_blocks`, which means importing
`atom.model_engine.model_runner`, which runs aiter's architecture probe and
raises where there is no GPU. That import is not stubbed around. The tree
already carries an aiter stub for this exact problem (`tests/aiter_stub.py`),
and it covers three module names -- measured 2026-09-22 in `xiaobizh_n18_cpu`,
`model_runner.py:20` imports a fourth, `aiter.dist.parallel_state`, and the
import fails there. Widening that stub is the thing `tests/conftest.py`'s own
header records as having silently stopped four test modules from running, so
the binding lives in `test_kv_budget_engine.py` and runs where there is a
driver.

What this tier holds is the half that decides whether the binding is right
rather than whether it runs: that ATOM's budget method reaches the device
through one call and through no other, that the four figures are handed back
under the names they were taken by, that four named proxies for that
arithmetic are not written down in this package, that the refusals it carries
read fields ATOM declares, and that the count carries what sized it.

The spec document and the model config are imported from `test_memory_readings`
rather than copied. The numbers here are the numbers there; a second MI355X
written out in this file would let the two drift and still pass.
