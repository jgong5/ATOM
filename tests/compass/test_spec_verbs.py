"""The three verbs over the spec: combining fragments, checking one, reading one.

The fragments below are the ones the probes of each hardware tier would emit --
a tokenizer and an interprocess measurement that need no device, a single-card
engine start, a multi-rank one, and a fabric measurement -- so a test that
combines them combines the same partial documents a real run would, and a test
that breaks one breaks exactly what it says it does.

The numbers are the measured ones wherever a measurement exists, because two of
these checks are judgements about size: the cross-rank spread accepted is the
one the hardware really shows, and the spread refused is the one a neighbour
really produced. Round numbers would make both tests vacuous.

The probe that needs no device has a section of its own. Its fragments are
built by the probe itself against a stand-in for the per-processor topology the
kernel publishes, so the core counts in them are read by the code a real run
reads them with rather than typed in beside the assertion that checks them.

The last two sections are the memory a probe that does start an engine reads
off each card, and the table of which probe supplies which runtime constant.
The readings are written as the term under test plus the rest of the card, so
a test says what it is about while the checks over them still see the four
numbers a rank really reports. The predictions they are judged
against are the spec's own measured reserves, which is what makes the accepted
readings and the refused one a judgement about size rather than about round
numbers.
