"""The vocabulary every cost is labelled with.

The point of these tests is that the label cannot be omitted. A cost whose
origin is unknown is worse than a missing cost, because it is counted, summed
and reported like a real one; the constructors are written so that producing
one takes a deliberate lie rather than an oversight, and these assert that
property rather than the spellings.

The refusal rendering is asserted too. It is not cosmetic: the string is what
lands in a run record, and a stand-in answer that renders the same as a
first-choice one would hide exactly the fall-through the record exists to
show. So is the composition rule -- a provenance that is resolved twice keeps
both refusals and both names, because a rung that is itself a ladder is the
ordinary shape and dropping half the chain there names the wrong rung.
