"""One request end to end through ATOM's real serving stack on the simulated clock.

A run is ATOM's API server started with ``--compass-run``: its engine core and
TP1 worker processes, the Compass runner priced by `ShapeStubBackend`, and
the Clock Authority co-hosted in the API server. The traffic LP is `Traffic`
below, in this process. The run is made twice, in two process trees with
different `PYTHONHASHSEED`, and the two step tables the authority writes are
compared byte for byte.

The engine core and the worker import aiter, and the worker's construction
still touches the device, so those tests skip where there is no driver. They
also skip without `ATOM_COMPASS_SLICE_MODEL`, a model directory holding a
config and a tokenizer; no weight is read.
