"""The stand-in model: the widths declared once, and what reads them.

The geometry and the price already exist and are already tested. What is
tested here is the join, and the reason a join is worth a type: a `KvGeometry`
is five integers and does not record the widths it was divided by, so a pool
sized for four ranks and a price charged as one rank's agree with each other
by accident or not at all. The first class below builds that mismatch to show
it is reachable, then shows the same declaration through `FakeModel` cannot
produce it.

Everything about a block count is asserted by handing the geometry to the code
that consumes it for real -- `page_pool` and `plan_pools` from
`atom.model_ops.attentions`, `BlockManager` from `atom.model_engine`, and
ATOM's own pipeline partitioner -- rather than by re-deriving the arithmetic
here, which would pass against a number the engine refuses.

The published Qwen3.8-27B config is vendored beside this file and is read
twice: once through this package's own JSON reader, and once through
`transformers`, so the reader is checked against the library rather than
against itself. The dialled stack is the other source the milestone needs --
shapes no released model has -- and it is read through the same code path, so
a test of it is a test of the reader and not of a second one.

Nothing here is an accuracy check. The coefficients behind every duration
below were declared, and the geometry is a double that omits the scale plane a
real backend carries. Every duration that carries a collective also depends on
which layer count the collective is charged per, which is a choice in the
pricing and not a property of this config; those expectations are keyed on
that count rather than written as one number, so a change to it moves them
rather than breaking them silently.
