"""ATOM's utility commands, sent through its own handler to the simulated runner.

`EngineUtilityHandler` is ATOM's, unchanged. The worker side is `busy_loop`'s
dispatch for one runner: `getattr(runner, name, None)`, call it, and forward
the reply only when it is not None. `test_runner_rpc_surface.py` pins that
structure over ATOM's source, so a reply `Worker` reports as never forwarded
is one the real worker never forwards either, and its caller waits forever.

Which worker method a command reaches is read off the handler's source, not
listed here.
