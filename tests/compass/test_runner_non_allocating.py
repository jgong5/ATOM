"""The runner subclass, and the construction that owns no device memory.

These run without a driver, which is the reason the behaviour lives in
`atom.compass.runner.overrides` rather than beside the subclass: importing
`atom.model_engine.model_runner` runs aiter's architecture probe, which shells
out to `rocminfo` and raises where there is no GPU. So the bodies are exercised
directly and the binding to ATOM's class is read from the source instead.

The two facts worth naming, because both were surprises:

* The base class warms the model from inside its own `__init__`, and warmup
  drives a forward. A runner with no weights therefore cannot construct unless
  it skips warmup -- the forward that warmup would drive is its own. That chain
  is asserted over ATOM's source below, so this stops being true loudly rather
  than quietly.
* Allocation is checked by counting dispatched operators, not by reading a CUDA
  allocator, so the check is meaningful on a machine with no CUDA allocator to
  read. A control asserts the counter sees an allocation when there is one;
  without it a broken counter and a clean runner look identical.

The import scan walks the package, so a root that does not resolve yields
nothing and the parametrisation passes on zero cases. The non-empty case is
asserted on its own, because the neighbouring test that reads a path under the
same root is what reddens this file today -- an accident of who its sibling is,
not a statement about this scan.

    That approximates what a module imports when it is imported, which is the

    nested in a module-scope `try:`/`except ImportError:`, in a module-scope
    `if`, or in a class body, all of which run at import; walking every node
    counts one inside a function body, which does not. So this walks and prunes
    at `def`/`lambda`, and the six forms below are checked against what the
    interpreter actually runs, rather than against the rule of thumb stated
    here.

    Module scope is the approximation, and it is loose in both directions. It
    over-catches a module-scope branch the interpreter never takes --
    `if TYPE_CHECKING:`, which is how someone annotating a signature with an
    engine type will write it, and `if False:` and `if __name__ ==
    "__main__":` with it -- and there top-level statements alone are what
    agrees with the interpreter. It under-catches a module-scope call of a
    function defined in the same module, whose body does import at import
    time, and there walking every node is what agrees. Neither is a defect a
    stricter predicate could remove: whether a call runs is not decidable from
    the source. The trade is taken deliberately, because the import that would
    strand this package is the one written at module scope.

    Both halves are load-bearing. `overrides.forward` takes its single engine
    import at call time, on a worker that has imported the engine already, so
    counting it would forbid the reply this package exists to build. And the
    `try:`/`except ImportError:` form is the one case where this assertion is
    the only guard there is: collecting the package without a driver would not
    fail on it, because the `except` swallows the failure. The under-catch is
    blind in the same place: the same `except` inside a function body hides
    that import from driverless collection too.
