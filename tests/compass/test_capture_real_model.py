"""One forward of the published Qwen3.8-27B, traced with no device, at TP1 and TP2.

This file is both the test and the capture driver. `pytest` runs the tests at
the bottom; each of them runs this same file as a script in a fresh interpreter
and reads the JSON record it prints. The subprocess is not isolation for its own
sake -- three pieces of the capture are process-global and one-shot, so two
widths cannot share an interpreter:

* `torch.distributed` is initialised once, at one world size;
* aiter's model-parallel state is module-global and asserts when re-entered;
* the `torch.cuda` and Triton substitutions below must be installed *before*
  `import atom`, and an import happens once per process.

Running it as a script also keeps the substitutions off every other test in the
tier: nothing here mutates `torch.cuda` in the pytest process.

What the capture is
-------------------
`TorchDispatchMode` over `FakeTensorMode(ShapeEnv())` with the Python dispatcher
enabled, around ATOM's own `ModelRunner` driving its own decode step through
ATOM's own model classes. No stub model and no synthetic config: the config is
the published `Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B` `config.json`, vendored beside this file and
checked byte-for-byte by sha256 before it is used.

**The inventories are DIAGNOSTIC, not captures.** Raw `@triton.jit` launches go
straight to the AMD driver and never enter the torch dispatcher, so
`FakeTensorMode` cannot fake them: the launcher asks a `FakeTensor` for its
`data_ptr` and the first kernel reached ends the trace. They are recorded and
not executed, which keeps the trace alive long enough to enumerate what a step
reaches -- but anything downstream of a skipped kernel read uninitialised fake
memory. The record says so in `diagnostic_inventory`, and these operator counts
are not a cost-model input at any width.

What is substituted, and what is not
------------------------------------
Substituted, all of it device facts declared by the caller rather than read from
a runtime: the `torch.cuda` namespace (17 names, each one read by a capture --
the record counts every read, see `_declare_cuda`); `rocminfo`, which aiter
shells out to at import and which needs `/dev/kfd`; Triton's active device
target; the collective *transport*, so
a group of width N needs no peer; and the three primitives `CpuGpuBuffer`
reaches for, because its two allocations and its numpy view have to straddle
the mode -- see `_staged_allocators`. What is *not* substituted there is the
constructor: ATOM's own `CpuGpuBuffer.__init__` executes, and the record
carries which one ran and what it allocated, so a change inside it cannot be
silent here.

Not substituted: the process group's width. The group here reports width 2
because it has width 2, and every collective ATOM issues is dispatched and
recorded. `apply_simulated_tp` is not what produced it: at one physical rank it
both erases and fabricates -- row-parallel `all_reduce` becomes the identity and
appears nowhere, while one `all_gather` becomes six dispatched ops over a
half-zeros tensor -- so a TP2 inventory taken through it is not a TP2
inventory. A sentinel sits over both bindings of it, but its one call site in
ATOM (held by a scan of ATOM's source, not assumed) is inside the method this
capture's runner overrides, so today the
sentinel is a guard over a path the capture does not execute rather than an
observation that ATOM at TP2 avoids it. What does observe the width is the
group's own `world_size` and the collectives it issued.

Where the shapes specialise, and what stopped it
------------------------------------------------
Three sites, in an order rather than a set. A free symbol is solved by whichever
line reaches it first, so repairing one does not always close what it solved:
closing the first moves the caller's bound into an ATOM assertion helper in
another file and a later phase of the step -- `forward_context.py`, reached
from the `run_model` call at `model_runner.py:3281`, with `prepare_inputs`
already returned. The plain symbolic pass records the first two; a third pass
simulates the first closed, from outside ATOM, and records what is behind it.
All three are pinned, and there is no claim that three is all there are -- only
that these three are what this instrument can reach today.

They are all symptoms of one line of torch: **`SymInt.__index__` and
`SymInt.__int__` are `guard_int`**. Every host-side use of the step's width
needs a number, gets the trace-time hint, and *records the ask as a guard that
makes the symbol a constant*. Sixteen ATOM lines do it in one forward, so
closing them one at a time does not converge.

The fourth pass, `--step-symbol`, is the one that specialises nowhere. It keeps
the conversion -- a host fill genuinely needs a number, and the number it needs
is the hint, which is the count ATOM computed -- and replaces the *recording*
with a log of every conversion and the ATOM line it happened on
(`_resolve_on_the_host`). That log is checked against a declared multiset,
`EXPECTED_HOST_RESOLUTIONS`, so a conversion at a line this capture did not
expect fails rather than joining the log unremarked. `__bool__` is untouched,
so a branch on a width still guards. It symbolises no staged buffer: their
dimensions are engine capacities, which is what the second site was really
about. The step's width is a symbol on the `ScheduledBatch` and ATOM derives
every bound from it -- with one exception, `ScheduledBatch.__init__` itself,
which solves the width by comparison rather than conversion, so the batch is
built at the concrete width and its four count fields are rebound afterwards
(see `_decode_batch`).

One line of ATOM changed for it, and only one: `assert_shape_contract`'s `_rows`
returns `t.shape[0]` rather than `int(t.shape[0])`. That is the third site, and
the only one of the three not reachable from a capture-time substitution.

    Substituted for the duration of one `__init__` body, so that what runs is
    ATOM's own body. The first version of this file replaced the method
    wholesale instead. The buffer built, but every line of ATOM's `__init__`
    was then unreachable: a `raise` as its first statement changed nothing
    anywhere in this file, and the repair route that makes `CpuGpuBuffer`
    symbolic -- an allocation change, and the
    allocation is `__init__` -- was the one route this test could not see.

    * `torch.zeros` for the host side runs outside the mode, so `self.cpu` is
      a real, numpy-backed, concrete tensor, which is the concrete half of
      the straddle. `pin_memory` is dropped: pinning is a real host allocation
      through the driver (`hipHostMalloc`), a property of the transfer rather
      than of the shape, and nothing traced here can observe it.
    * `torch.zeros_like` for the device side is substituted **only** in the
      symbolic pass. `static_shapes=False` is what puts a free symbol on each
      dimension; a tensor allocated inside the mode is already fake and
      *static*, with plain `int` shapes and no sign that anything was lost.
      The symbolic side is converted from a template that is then dropped, not
      from `self.cpu`: converting `self.cpu` memoises it as a symbolic fake,
      and the first operator ATOM performs on the CPU side directly then asks
      the converter for a concrete view of a tensor it has already given a
      symbolic meta storage -- `Trying to resize storage that is not
      resizable`. In the concrete pass ATOM's own `zeros_like` runs unaltered.
    * `Tensor.numpy` runs outside the mode. A `.numpy()` taken while the mode
      is active leaves the real storage marked not resizable, and the next
      operator on the CPU side then fails inside the converter with a
      deprecation warning about reading a FakeTensor data pointer as the only
      clue. The numpy view is a host alias, not an operation worth tracing.

    Each substitution counts its calls, and the counts go in the record. They
    are what says ATOM's body ran, and they move if its allocations are added
    to, removed or re-routed -- which is the other half of closing the hole.

    It is handed to the `ScheduledBatch` as its token and sequence counts, and

    `running_bs` and `running_tokens` off it, `prepare_inputs` writes the
    `cu_seqlens_q` boundary at `running_bs + 1`, and `prepare_decode` uses it as
    every staged buffer's bound. None of that arithmetic is re-done here --
    supplying a bound per buffer, which is what `_symbolic_bound` does for the
    probe above, is a width this capture chose rather than one ATOM ran.

    **One symbol, not two.** A decode step has one query row per sequence, so
    its token count and its sequence count are the same number for a structural
    reason and not by coincidence: `running_tokens` is `running_bs * q` with
    `q == 1`. Minting a symbol for each would produce a graph in which the
    hidden states and the attention metadata carry unrelated widths, and ATOM's
    own shape contract -- which asserts the two agree -- would then have to
    equate them, which is the specialisation again by a longer route.

    for. It is built outside the mode: a tensor allocated inside it is already
    fake and *static*, `from_tensor` is then a no-op, and what comes back is a
    plain `int` with nothing to say it was meant to be a symbol.

    torch specialises those two sizes to constants by design. A capture that
    went on from there would produce a fully concrete record wearing

    This is what makes the step-symbol pass possible, and it is aimed at the

    `SymInt.__int__` are `guard_int`.** ATOM's staging has to fill `self.np[:n]`
    and slice a Python list, and both of those need a number. The conversion is
    not the problem. The problem is the *recording*: `guard_int` installs
    `Eq(s, hint)` and every shape downstream of the symbol is a constant from
    there, with no error and no warning.

    So the conversion is kept and the recording is replaced by this record.
    `__index__` and `__int__` return the symbol's hint, which is the count ATOM
    computed, and every one of them is logged with the ATOM frames it happened
    through. Nothing is hidden, and nothing is taken on trust: the log is
    compared, as a multiset of `(ATOM line, conversions)`, against the declared
    `EXPECTED_HOST_RESOLUTIONS`, at both group widths and both step widths. A
    conversion at a line this capture did not expect fails that comparison
    rather than joining the log unremarked -- which is the whole of what makes
    this an instrument rather than a decoration, and which this docstring
    claimed before anything implemented it.

    What is *not* touched is `__bool__` and the comparisons that reach it. A
    branch on a symbol still installs its guard, so a step whose shape decides
    which path ATOM takes still records that it did.

    `_HintSlicedView` above is the narrow form of the same idea, applied to one

    Three passes, because they answer different questions and cannot be one

    concrete on both sides, as ATOM builds them, and what comes out is the
    inventory -- the operators, the collectives, and a shape census that is the
    claim about the inventory rather than about the mechanism.

    `symbolic=True` is the probe. It gives every staged buffer's device side a
    free symbol per dimension and hands `prepare_decode` its row count as a
    symbol too, then records where each one stopped being free. Symbols that
    survive are not evidence of anything here: a handful reach `as_strided`,
    `reshape` and `slice` on views that no compute operator consumes.

    `repair_site_one=True` is the same probe with the first of those places
    simulated closed, from outside ATOM (`_HintSlicedView`). It exists because
    the specialisation sites are **ordered**, not independent: closing the one
    that solves the bound first does not close the bound, it moves it. The
    record that pass produces is the source for the third site.

    `step_symbol=True` is the fourth pass, and the only one that specialises
    nowhere. It does not symbolise the staged buffers at all -- their
    dimensions are engine capacities and are not a function of the step -- and
    it hands no bound to `prepare_decode`. The step's *width* is a free symbol
    on the `ScheduledBatch` and ATOM derives every bound from it, while
    `_resolve_on_the_host` lets the symbol answer a host fill with its hint

    None has moved and none has been removed. What changed is the outcome:

    **Site one**, the bound at the caller. `prepare_decode` still fills a
    staged buffer's numpy view with the count, and a host fill still needs a
    number, so the symbol is still converted there. It is converted to its hint
    and logged as a host resolution, where it used to be converted to a guard
    that made every shape downstream a constant. The line appears in
    `host_resolutions` and in nothing else.

    **Site two**, inside the buffer. `copy_to_gpu` runs the line it always ran,
    and the staged buffer is ATOM's own, unsymbolised. The bound carries the
    symbol, so both slices carry it and the copy dispatches with it; the line
    appears as the call site of operators whose shapes are not numbers.

    **Site three**, `assert_shape_contract`'s `_rows`. This is the one the
    production change is for, and it is the only one that could not be closed
    from outside ATOM: `int(t.shape[0])` converts a dimension the assertion
    then compares against a symbolic width. It no longer converts, so it
    appears nowhere.

    **And the whole log is held, not just those three lines.** The point of
    replacing the recording with a log is that a conversion nobody expected
    fails rather than joining the log unremarked, and a membership test on one
    site does not do that: a seventeenth ATOM line converting the width would
    add an entry and nothing would notice. The multiset of `(ATOM line,
    conversions)` is asserted against `EXPECTED_HOST_RESOLUTIONS` instead, at
    both widths of the group and both step widths, because that is the property
    the instrument is claimed to have.

    This test cannot be passed by removing a site: a `copy_to_gpu` that stopped

    """Two widths, one inventory: the evidence that the symbol is not a hint.

    This is the load-bearing evidence for the whole result, and it is the only
    thing here that can see a symbol *lost* rather than solved -- code reading
    a hint and building a tensor of that size records no replacement and
    installs no guard.

    ATOM computes its host values from the symbol's hint -- the slot mapping,
    the block tables, the cumulative sequence lengths are all real numbers for
    one concrete width. A graph with symbolic shapes built that way would still
    be a graph about one width if any dimension had quietly taken the hint
    instead of the symbol, and nothing in the census would say so.

    So the step is traced twice, at two widths, and the two inventories are
    compared operator for operator and shape for shape with the symbol's *name*
    set aside. They are identical. Anything carrying the hint would be a 2 in
    one and an 8 in the other.

    That is also what the concrete half of the census rests on: every dimension
    that stayed a number is the same number at both widths, so none of them is
    a step width in disguise. They are the model's and the engine's -- hidden
    sizes, head counts, projection widths, and the staging buffers' capacities.

    **One of those constants is a 2, and it is not the step's.** At TP2 the
    value 2 appears 73 times in the concrete half of the census -- it is the
    *group's* width, which this step really does have. The identity above is
    what separates the two readings: the concrete dimensions are the same at
    step width 2 and at step width 8, so a 2 that survives a step eight rows
    wide is an engine constant and not a width that leaked. At TP1 no 2 appears
    at all.

    **At TP2 as well as TP1.** TP2 is the width the result is named for and the
    one where a capture has most to lose, so the comparison that carries the
    result is run there too rather than inferred from TP1.

    **What the digest covers, and the one artifact that differs.** The digest
    is over operator names and tensor shapes: not scalar arguments, not dtypes,
    not strides. The single control-versus-symbol difference this file reports,
    `lift_fresh` becoming `scalar_tensor`, is a *value*-level difference and
    was found by comparing `distinct_ops`, which is the instrument for that.
    And one artifact genuinely is not identical between the two widths -- the
    guard set, which acquires a lower bound `<axis> + 1 > <hint>` at every hint
    but 2. It is asserted here rather than left out of the comparison, because
    a reader told five rows are identical should be told which row is not and
    why it does not disturb the conclusion: it is a `__bool__` comparison on a
    live symbol, which is the boundary this pass left alive on purpose.
