"""The pipeline-stage block count, re-derived rather than restated.

The memory and KV design document used to say that the `all_reduce(MIN)`
across pipeline stages in `get_num_blocks` is inert, *because every stage
computes the same number*, and that it *still needs a live process group or a
stub*. Both halves were wrong, and prose is how they stayed wrong: nothing
re-checked them.

So this file checks them, and then checks that the document still says what
was checked -- the table, and the sentence naming the widths at which the
reduction binds. The split is never written out here: it comes from ATOM's own
`get_pp_indices`, which hands the remainder to the *middle* partitions and so
produces a layout no reader would guess. `VLLM_PP_LAYER_PARTITION` overrides
that partitioner, so every derivation clears it first; left set, this reads a
layer layout out of the environment and calls it ATOM's.

The budget, the block size and the widths are choices, not measurements, and
they are named constants for that reason: what is derived here is how the
count *moves* between stages, not its absolute value. The model is the
64-layer hybrid vendored beside this file -- one full-attention layer in four,
so 16 of the 64 hold paged KV. A stage's paged-layer count is therefore not a
function of the layers it holds, which is why both are derived and both are
pinned.

The guard on the reduce is read out of ATOM's source with `ast` rather than by
importing it: the claim is about what the code says, and the runner does not
import on a machine with no driver. It is matched by attribute name and scoped
to `get_num_blocks`, not matched against the text `torch.distributed.all_reduce`
-- the runner reaches the same function through an aliased `dist.all_reduce`
elsewhere, so a spelling-bound matcher would be making a claim about a spelling
while sounding like one about the file.

    five-layer stages share one. An early paraphrase of this said three, so
    the counts are asserted as a list rather than as a cardinality.

    Every width from 2 to 8 is taken, because the reason given for the

    would hold at all of them. It is inert at 2, 4 and 8, and nowhere else

    inside the `is_initialized()` branch -- so with no group nothing runs, and
    nothing has to be stubbed for it.

    Both comprehensions are scoped to `get_num_blocks` and match the called
