"""The invalidation matrix, the gate state in the artifact, and the ledger.

**The whole matrix is exercised, not one row, and the zeroes as hard as the
crosses.** `test_every_cell_of_the_matrix_decides_by_itself` walks all
forty-two cells: where the matrix says a row depends on an axis, moving that
axis refuses and the refusal names the cell; where it says the row does not,
moving the same axis loads clean. A matrix that has been tidied into a uniform rule
passes neither half, and the pair the brief names -- `price_list` surviving a
model change while `region_terms` refuses one -- is also published and loaded
through the store, because a table that is right in the abstract and unwired
in the store is the machinery-with-no-caller shape this package's own review
found once already.

Two things this file deliberately does not do, both inherited.

**It binds no `width`.** The matrix's six columns contain no width at all, so
invalidation does not need #165 ruled; where a key field happens to be
called `width` the topology here is tensor-parallel only, so the two candidate
readings coincide and no fixture settles the question by example.

**It rules nothing that is the owner's.** Whether an aiter bump invalidates
or only warns is #168, and until it is ruled the default stands:
`test_an_aiter_bump_refuses_until_its_meaning_is_ruled` pins the default, and
it is the test that changes when the ruling lands.

Nothing here touches a driver, a device or a network. The conditions are
stated and never probed, which is also why a fixture can express a ROCm bump
on a host that has one ROCm.
