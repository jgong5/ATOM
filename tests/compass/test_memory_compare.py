"""Two instruments on one breakdown: the per-term gate, and the sum that hid it.

The per-term rule comes from an incident. A summed non-KV memory check read
**+13.8%** and was three errors, two of which cancelled: weights over by
**+0.280 GB**, activations compared at the wrong shape (**-0.015 GB**), and
**-0.084 GB** of a resident term nobody had noticed existed. **The largest
single error was 25% of its own term.**

`HISTORICAL` below is that breakdown, and the named result of this task is the
two instruments run on it side by side -- the per-term comparator naming three
failures, and the summed check reading +13.8% and passing.

**How the fixture's totals were reconstructed, since the incident was reported
as deltas and ratios rather than totals.** Three deltas are given (+0.280, -0.015,
-0.084 GB), and two ratios: the largest error is 25% of its term, and the sum
is +13.8%. The largest error by bytes is the weights one, so the recorded
weights follow exactly: `0.280 / 0.25 = 1.120 GB`. The three deltas sum to
+0.181 GB, so the recorded terms sum to `0.181 / 0.138`, and the rounding of
13.8% pins that sum to `(1.30686, 1.31636]` GB -- leaving the recorded
activations in `(0.10286, 0.11236]` GB. The fixture takes **0.110 GB**, the
only figure the incident's numbers do not determine, and the resulting sum is
+13.77%, which is the +13.8% the incident reported. Nothing else in the fixture is chosen.

Every test in this file runs with both device readings patched to raise, for the
same reason the readings tests do: a comparator that needed a card would be
useless for sizing a card nobody has. The import-graph check that settles it
for every branch at once lives in `test_memory_readings.py` and globs the
package, so `compare.py` is inside it already.
