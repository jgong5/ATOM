"""The classified list of blocking calls on the serving path, kept honest.

A simulated run substitutes predicted durations for real work, so it has to
know every call that parks a thread on the real clock. The list of them is in
`atom/compass/audit/sync_sites.json`; deciding what each one is was a reading
job and cannot be re-derived. What *can* be re-derived is the set of call sites
that exist, and these tests assert the two agree -- so a blocking call added to
ATOM later fails here instead of quietly widening the blind spot.

Two failures are worth telling apart, and each has its own test:

* a call site the list does not classify, or a listed site that has gone away
  (`test_every_scanned_site_is_classified`) -- read it and classify it;
* a pinned piece of text that is no longer exactly once in its symbol
  (`test_anchors_are_still_where_they_say`) -- the same, for the points that
  are not a call.

Neither records a line number, so an edit above a site or an anchor changes
nothing here.

Separately, each row's mechanism is checked against what the rest of the row
says (`test_every_mechanism_agrees_with_the_rest_of_its_row`).

A row is only safe to keep across an edit if it cannot silently change which
call it describes, which is what `test_inserting_a_call_above_another_leaves_
its_neighbour_alone` pins: an earlier identity keyed on the callee alone, so
inserting one `call_func("flush_pp_send", ...)` above a `call_func("forward",
...)` moved every later row onto the wrong site.

No driver, and no import of ATOM's serving modules: the scanner parses them.
