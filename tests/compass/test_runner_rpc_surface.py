"""The names a worker dispatches, and the reply each caller is waiting for.

`AsyncIOProc.busy_loop` resolves every RPC with `getattr(runner, name, None)`
and forwards the result only `if out is not None`. Both halves fail quietly:

* a name the runner does not have is skipped, the worker stays healthy, and a
  `wait_out=True` caller blocks on an unbounded `outputs_queue.get()` for the
  rest of the process's life;
* a method that answers None does the same thing, one step later.

Raising is the loud path, and the tests below pin the chain that makes it loud:
the worker dies, the manager's process monitor turns that into a `SystemExit`
on the output queue, and `call_func` re-raises it in the caller. What crosses
that boundary is the type and nothing else -- the `SystemExit` is constructed
with no arguments -- so the rule this file enforces is not "return something
sensible" but **return what the call site unpacks**, checked against ATOM's
source, never against a list anyone typed here.

Nothing here imports `atom.model_engine.model_runner`: that import runs aiter's
architecture probe, which shells out to `rocminfo` and raises where there is no
GPU. The composed class is therefore read from source, the way the sibling
module's tests read it.
