"""A block count out of ATOM's own budget arithmetic, with the card unread.

This is the one file in `tests/compass/` that needs a driver, and it needs one
for a reason that has nothing to do with reading a device: importing
`atom.model_engine.model_runner` runs aiter's architecture probe, which shells
out to `rocminfo`. So the tier is decided by an import, not by the test --
which is why every device reading is patched to raise for every test here. The
pool is sized on a machine that has a card, from a spec describing a different
one, and the card that is present is never asked anything.

The runner is built with `object.__new__` and given the attributes
`get_num_blocks` reads. Constructing one for real would load a checkpoint,
build a module tree and open a process group, none of which this is about. The
budget arithmetic that runs is ATOM's own, unmodified and unwrapped: this file
calls `CompassModelRunner.get_num_blocks`, whose body is a refusal check, a
`super()` call and a record.

The entry size the pool is planned from comes from `backends/geometry`, not
from an attention builder, because a builder is attached to a constructed
engine. That is the declaration `plan_pools` consumes; `plan_pools` itself, and
every line of budget arithmetic above it, is ATOM's.

Both halves of the sizing are built at the same width, and the entry size is
pinned as well as the count so that they cannot drift apart again: the readings
describe one rank's memory, so the block they are divided by has to be one
rank's block. Nothing downstream of `plan_pools` can tell that it was not --
the count comes back plausible either way.
